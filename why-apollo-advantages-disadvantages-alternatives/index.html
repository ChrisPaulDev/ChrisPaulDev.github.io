                            <p>Finding the right solution for a given problem is not always simple, and web applications
                                build with GraphQL are a good example of how changing times make for constantly evolving
                                challenges. Moreover, evolving challenges create a scenario where the solutions must
                                also evolve, so even the number of choices becomes a task. This article will decipher
                                the pros and cons of one such solution: Apollo for GraphQL, with alternative solutions
                                in case you decide against it.</p>

                            <p>GraphQL is only the query language that has a reference implementation in JavaScript, and
                                Apollo builds its ecosystem on top to make GraphQL available for a wider audience. This
                                includes the client-side as well as the server-side, because they provide a large
                                ecosystem of libraries for both. The libraries provide an intermediate layer too: Apollo
                                Engine, which is a GraphQL gateway. Essentially there&rsquo;s a reason Apollo is one of
                                the most popular choices for using GraphQL in JavaScript applications.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="apollo-advantages">Apollo Advantages</h2>

                            <p>The following topics show you some of the advantages of using Apollo, to provide a
                                well-rounded pro and con list. Feel free to contact me if you think anything is missing
                                from either list.</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-ecosystem">Apollo&#39;s Ecosystem</h3>

                            <p>While GraphQL is in its early stages, the Apollo ecosystem offers solutions for many of
                                its challenges. Beyond that we can see how much the ecosystem is growing, because the
                                company announces an update for Apollo or another library that can be used with
                                Apollo&rsquo;s tech stack at every other technology conference. Apollo isn&rsquo;t just
                                covering GraphQL, though; they also have effort invested in REST interfaces for backward
                                compatibility to RESTful architectures. This even takes GraphQL beyond the network layer
                                and remote data, offering a state management solution for local data, too.</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-company-community">The Company and Community behind Apollo</h3>

                            <p>The company behind Apollo is pouring lots of resources into its success. They are also
                                active in open source, offering in-depth articles about their products, supported by an
                                established presence at the conferences. In general, the GraphQL ecosystem <a

                                    href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/prisma">seems to be in good shape for the
                                    future</a>. The community behind GraphQL is growing, as more developers adopt it and
                                use Apollo for client and server-side JavaScript applications.</p>

                            <p>Tech-savvy companies are taking advantage of Apollo already. Many were familiar with the
                                popular Meteor framework before, but new and extremely popular companies like Airbnb and
                                Twitch are using it. These are just a few of their stories:</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-documentation">Apollo&#39;s Documentation</h3>

                            <p>While Apollo continues to evolve, the team and community behind it keeps the
                                documentation up to date, and they have plenty of insight about how to build
                                applications. In fact, they cover so many areas it can be overwhelming for beginners.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-libraries">Apollo Libraries</h3>

                            <p>Apollo offers plenty of libraries for implementing an effective GraphQL tech stack for
                                JavaScript applications, and their libraries are open-sourced to be more manageable. For
                                instance, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/">Apollo Link</a> provides an API for
                                chaining different features into a GraphQL control flow. This makes it possible for
                                automatic network retries or RESTful API endpoints instead of a GraphQL endpoints (the
                                endpoints can be used together, too).</p>

                            <p>Apollo is also offering exchangeable libraries which can be seen in the Apollo Client
                                Cache. The Apollo Client itself is not biased toward its cache, where the data is
                                stored, as any cache advertised by Apollo or its community works. There are already
                                caches available that can be used to setup a Apollo Client instance.</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-features">Apollo&#39;s Features</h3>

                            <p>Apollo comes with built-in features to pull all the complexity out of applications and
                                handle the intersection between client and server applications. For instance, Apollo
                                Client caches requests, which are not made twice when the result is already in the
                                cache. The function provides a performance boost for applications, saving valuable
                                network traffic. Also, Apollo Client normalizes data, so nested data from a GraphQL
                                query is stored in a normalized data structure in the Apollo Client Cache. Data can be
                                read from the Apollo Client Cache by an identifier, without looking up an
                                &ldquo;article&rdquo; entity in an &ldquo;author&rdquo; entity. Beyond caching and
                                normalization, Apollo Client comes with many more features like error management,
                                support for pagination and optimistic UI, prefetching of data, and connection of the
                                data layer (Apollo Client) to the view layer (e.g. React).</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-interoperability">Interoperability with other Frameworks</h3>

                            <p>One of Apollo&rsquo;s libraries makes it possible to connect Apollo Client to React. Just
                                like libraries like Redux and MobX, the React-Apollo library has higher-order and render
                                prop components to connect both worlds. However, there are other libraries out there
                                that bridge not only Apollo Client to React, but also Apollo to Angular or Apollo to
                                Vue. That&rsquo;s what makes Apollo Client view layer agnostic, which is great for the
                                growing JavaScript ecosystem.</p>

                            <p>Apollo is also library agnostic on the server-side, and it offers several solutions to
                                connect with Node.js libraries. Apollo Server for Express.js is one of the most popular
                                choices among developers and companies, and there are other solutions for Koa and Hapi
                                on Node.js for Apollo Server as well.</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-data-handling">Modern Data Handling with Apollo</h3>

                            <p>Remember back when we had to trigger data fetching in a component&rsquo;s lifecycle
                                methods imperatively? Apollo Client solves this, because its data queries are
                                declarative. React often employs a higher-order component or render prop to trigger a
                                query automatically when a component renders. The GraphQL mutations are triggered
                                imperatively, but that&rsquo;s only because a higher-order component or render prop
                                grants access to the function which executes the mutation (e.g. on a button click).
                                Essentially, Apollo embraces declarative programming over imperative programming.</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-state-management">Modern State Management with GraphQL and Apollo</h3>

                            <p>With the rise of GraphQL in JavaScript applications, state management entered another
                                state of confusion. Even though lots of pain points are eliminated using a GraphQL
                                library like Apollo Client, since it takes care of state management for remote data,
                                some developers are confused about where to put state management libraries like Redux or
                                MobX now. However, it can be made simple using these libraries for local data only and
                                leaving the remote data to Apollo. There is no longer a need to fetch data with
                                asynchronous actions in Redux, so it becomes a predictable state container for all the
                                remaining application state (e.g. local data/view data/UI data). In fact, the remaining
                                application state may be simple enough to be managed by React&rsquo;s local state
                                instead of Redux.</p>

                            <p>Meanwhile, Apollo has already released their own solution to manage local
                                state&ndash;which is supposed to be managed by React&rsquo;s local state, Redux or
                                MobX&ndash;by embracing GraphQL for everything. The Apollo Link State library lets us
                                manage local data with GraphQL operations, except on the client-side in Apollo Client.
                                It&rsquo;s Apollo saying: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need any other state management
                                library, we take care of your data.&rdquo; These are exciting times for developing
                                JavaScript applications.</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-development-experience">Convenient Development Experience</h3>

                            <p>Using Apollo for JavaScript applications is becoming easier every day. The community is
                                pushing out tools for implementation. There are development tools available as browser
                                extensions, third-party tools to perform GraphQL operations such as GraphiQL, and
                                libraries to simplify developing Apollo applications. For instance, the Apollo Boost
                                library provides an almost zero-configuration Apollo Client setup to get started with
                                GraphQL for client-side applications. Apollo takes away all the boilerplate
                                implementation that comes with the GraphQL reference implementation in JavaScript.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="apollo-disadvantages">Apollo Disadvantages</h2>

                            <p>The following topics show you some of the disadvantages of using Apollo, to provide a
                                well-rounded pro and con list. Feel free to contact me if you think anything is missing
                                from either list.</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</h3>

                            <p>GraphQL is in its early stages. Apollo users and all early GraphQL adopters are working
                                with brand new technology. The Apollo team is developing a rich ecosystem around
                                GraphQL, providing the basics as well as advanced features like caching and monitoring.
                                This comes with pitfalls, however, mainly because everything isn&rsquo;t set in stone.
                                There are sporadic changes that can pose challenges when you are updating
                                GraphQL-related libraries. In contrast, some libraries in GraphQL might be more
                                conservative than the Apollo team, but the features usually aren&rsquo;t as powerful.
                            </p>

                            <p>The ability for developers to continue learning is also hindered by fast-pace
                                development. Tutorials for GraphQL and Apollo are sometimes outdated, and finding an
                                answer may require external resources. The same is true for most new technology, though.
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-under-construction">Under Construction</h3>

                            <p>The Apollo team and community implements many new features in a rapid pace, but going so
                                fast comes with a price. Searching for solutions often leads to GitHub, because there is
                                little other information on the subject. While you may indeed find a GitHub issue for
                                your problem, there is often no solution for it.</p>

                            <p>Rapid development also comes with the price of neglecting obsolete earlier versions. In
                                my experience, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/2593">people seemed
                                    confused when Apollo abandoned Redux</a> as their internal state management
                                solution. Apollo isn&rsquo;t opinionated about how Redux should be used side by side
                                with it, but since it has been abandoned as internal state management solution, many
                                people didn&rsquo;t know how to proceed when Apollo 2.0 was released. I think the team
                                behind Apollo might be struggling to keep up with the fast-paced GraphQL ecosystem, and
                                it&rsquo;s not always easy to heed all voices in open source development.</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-bold-fashionable">It is Bold and Fashionable</h3>

                            <p>Apollo is bold, because it is moving beyond being a network layer ecosystem between
                                client and server for GraphQL in JavaScript, but positioning itself as the data
                                management solution of tomorrow. It connects client and backend applications with
                                GraphQL, apollo-link-rest for RESTful APIs, and apollo-link-state for local state
                                management. Some experts are skeptical about the &ldquo;GraphQL everything&rdquo;
                                mentality, but time will tell if it corners that market.</p>

                            <p>Apollo is fashionable, because it keeps up with the latest trends. In React, the latest
                                trend was render prop components. Because of this, and arguably the benefits of render
                                prop components over higher-order components, the React Apollo library introduced <a
                                    href="../react-render-props-pattern/index.html">render prop components</a> next to
                                higher-order components. It was a smart move to offer multiple solutions since both
                                higher-order and render prop components come with their own sets of pros and cons.
                                However, Apollo does advocate for render props over higher-order components, and
                                it&rsquo;s not clear if this was hype-driven development or marketing or if they truly
                                believe that this is the way of the future. Render props are relatively new in React, so
                                it will take time for developers to realize they come with their own pitfalls (see:
                                higher-order components). I have seen React applications become too verbose by using
                                multiple render prop components in one React component, even though one render prop
                                didn&rsquo;t depend on another render prop, rather than having those co-located to the
                                React component by using higher-order components. After all, Apollo offers both
                                solutions, render props and higher-order components, so the developer decides on a case
                                by case basis for their applications. It&rsquo;s a good sign for users that the Apollo
                                team is keeping up with the recent trends from other libraries, and not confining
                                themselves to a bubble.</p>

                            <h3 id="apollo-competition">Missing Competition</h3>

                            <p>Most of these concerns are about the newness of GraphQL, concerns that could be applied
                                to virtually any other open source solution in the same field. One major concern,
                                though, is the missing competition in the GraphQL in JavaScript domain. A couple of
                                alternatives to Apollo are listed in the next section, but they are limited compared to
                                the Apollo ecosystem. While it is possible to write your own library for GraphQL (e.g.
                                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                                    client</a>), not many developers have attempted it yet. Some problems solved by
                                Apollo are not trivial, but I think competition would be a healthy push for GraphQL in
                                JavaScript ecosystem. There is huge potential in GraphQL now, and open source developers
                                would be wise to take advantage.</p>

                            <p>Some disadvantages stem from using GraphQL as an alternative to a RESTful-driven
                                architecture. There are some alternatives for Apollo Client and Apollo Server that can
                                consume GraphQL APIs in JavaScript. The following list should grant insights about
                                solutions in the JavaScript ecosystem, used for React on the client-side and Node.js on
                                the server-side.</p>

                                Angular, Vue, or similar applications, there are several alternatives to check out. Like
                                Apollo, these come with their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

                                        perform your GraphQL operations, GraphQL itself isn&rsquo;t opinionated about
                                        the network layer. So it is possible for you to use GraphQL with plain HTTP
                                        methods using only one endpoint with an opinionated payload structure for
                                        GraphQL queries and mutations.</p>

                                applications, when you want to use a GraphQL interface over a RESTful interface. Their
                                libraries are framework agnostic, so they can be used with a wide variety of frameworks
