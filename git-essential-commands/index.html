                                <p>This tutorial is part 2 of 2 in the series.</p>
                                <div>Part 1: <a href="../developer-setup/index.html" itemprop="url">My development setup
                                        as a JavaScript web developer</a></div>
                            </div>

                            <p>When you get started with Git, it can be quite overwhelming. First, the idea of a
                                distributed version control system and the benefits of it are not clear for everyone.
                                And second, there are plenty of commands with additional options in order to master Git
                                on the command line. It can be intimidating.</p>

                            <p>However, you will never need all the combinations of commands and options in Git. For me
                                they break down to only a few essential commands that I use for web development.
                                Everything else can be looked up whenever complex problems arise.</p>

                            <p>In this article, I want to give you a brief introduction to Git and GitHub, how to get
                                started and how to use it. Afterward, I want to show you my essential commands for Git
                                that enabled me to do web development in the recent years. It&rsquo;s no magic and
                                doesn&rsquo;t need to be overwhelming.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="why-git-github">Why Git and GitHub?</h2>

                            <p>Git is a version control system for tracking file/folder snapshots and their changes
                                across multiple machines. Most of the time, the files are related to software, for
                                instance the source code of an application, but they don&rsquo;t need to be only of this
                                kind. I already met writers and content marketers using Git to organize their files and
                                to collaborate with others.</p>

                            <p>These files and folders are grouped into a repository. Multiple people can collaborate on
                                a repository. Basically a repository is your project&rsquo;s container for Git and
                                GitHub. People can create a local copy of the repository, modify the folders/files, and
                                sync all the changes back to the remote repository. All collaborators can pull the
                                recent changes from the remote repository to their local repository.</p>

                            <p>While Git happens on the command line by executing commands to pull, modify and push
                                repositories, GitHub is the web-based Git platform. You can create repositories on the
                                GitHub website and synchronize them to with a project on your local machine. Afterward,
                                you can use Git on the command line to execute commands.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="remote-local-repository">Remote vs. Local Repository?</h2>

                            <p>In GitHub, a person or organization (e.g. Facebook, Airbnb) can have repositories. These
                                repositories can have files or whole folder structures for source code, markdown or
                                other content. Unless a repository is private, everyone has reading access to it. It is
                                a remote repository, because it is decentralized from your local machine.</p>

                            <p>Yet everyone is able to make a copy of the remote repository to his or her local machine.
                                It becomes a local repository. You can make changes in your local repository that are
                                not immediately reflected in the remote repository. You decide when or whether you want
                                to merge the changes back to the remote repository.</p>

                            <p>The local repository can be used to experiment with source code, to add improvements or
                                to fix issues. Eventually, these adjustments in the local repository get merged back to
                                the remote repository. However, the collaborator has to have writing permission for the
                                remote repository.</p>

                            <p>The distribution of repositories makes it possible to collaborate as a group on one
                                remote repository when everyone has reading and writing access. A local repository is
                                used to perform changes while the remote repository is the single source of truth.</p>

                            <p>GitHub offers the possibility to make repositories private. But you would have to upgrade
                                to a paid GitHub account. Once your GitHub profile is upgraded, you can make any
                                repository private thus only visible for yourself.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="getting-started-git-github">Getting started with Git and
                                GitHub Setup</h2>

                            <p>Now that you know about Git and GitHub, you might wonder how to get started. That&rsquo;s
                                fairly straight forward, covered by multiple guides, but also by the GitHub website
                                itself.</p>

                            <p>First, visit the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/">official GitHub website</a> to create an account. Second,
                                you have to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/">install Git</a> on your command
                                line. Every operating system should come with a default command line, but you can check
                                <a href="../developer-setup/index.html">this developer setup guide</a> to get to know my
                                setup. Third, I highly recommend to setup SSH for your GitHub account. It is optional
                                but secures your access to GitHub. In addition, it leaves out the tedious task where you
                                always have to enter your credentials when you push changes of your local repository to
                                a remote repository on GitHub.</p>

                            <p>Last but not least, explore and socialize on GitHub. You can explore different
                                repositories by visiting profiles of people and organizations. You can watch and star
                                the repositories to get updates and to show your admiration. You can even start to
                                contribute on a repository as a open source contributor.</p>

                            <p>In order to socialize, you can follow people who start interesting projects or
                                discussions on GitHub. Try it out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                                    connection</a>. I would be keen to see you using it.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="initialize-git-repository">Initialize a repository with Git
                                and GitHub</h2>

                            <p>In the beginning, you somehow have to initialize a Git repository. You can initialize a
                                local repository by using the <code>git init</code> command in a project&rsquo;s folder
                                on your local machine.</p>

                            <p>A local repository has a <em>.git</em> file where all the information, for instance the
                                commit history, about the repository is saved. Another file, a <em>.gitignore</em> file,
                                can be added to ignore certain files which shouldn&rsquo;t be added to the remote
                                repository. Ignored files are only in your local repository.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">init</span>
<span style="color: #06b6ef">touch</span> <span style="color: #e7e9db">.</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">gitignore</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>For instance, you may want to ignore the <em>.env</em> file where you store sensible
                                environment variables of your project or the <em>node_modules/</em> folder for not
                                uploading all your project dependencies to your remote GitHub repository.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #e7e9db">.</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">env</span>

<span style="color: #06b6ef">node_modules</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>After you have used the <code>git init</code> command in your local project, you can
                                create a repository on GitHub. There you can give it a name, an optional description and
                                license (e.g. MIT). Don&rsquo;t use the checkbox for adding a README.md. Instead, leave
                                the checkbox unchecked. Then you get the instructions to link your local repository to
                                your remote repository in the next step.</p>

                            <p>In addition, you may want to add a <em>README.md</em> file in your project which is then
                                displayed in your repository on GitHub. Basically that&rsquo;s everything you need to
                                know for initializing a git project, adding the <em>.gitignore</em> file to it,
                                connecting it to your remote repository on GitHub, add adding changes to it with the
                                add, commit, and push sequence. You will learn more about this sequence in the next
                                section.</p>

                            <p>Otherwise, if you check the checkbox, you will have a ready to go remote repository which
                                you can clone then to your local machine for having it as local repository. If you want
                                to have a copy of a remote repository, you can clone it by using
                                <code>git clone &lt;repository_url&gt;</code> to your local machine.</p>

                            <p>After you have linked your local repository and added, committed and pushed your initial
                                project to the remote repository (not when you have cloned it), you can start to adjust
                                your project (local repository). Afterward, you always follow the add, commit and push
                                sequence. More about this in the next section.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="push-git-changes">Push your Changes</h2>

                            <p>Over the past years, I have noticed that the GitHub commands I use break down to only a
                                few essential ones that I use in recurring scenarios. These essential commands were
                                quite sufficient for me to come along in web development.</p>

                            <p>Once you have a local repository, you want to &ldquo;commit&rdquo; changes to the code
                                base. Each commit is saved as an atomic step that changes your repository. It is saved
                                in the Git history that is accessible on the command line and GitHub.</p>

                            <p>Commits come with a commit message. You will see later on how to write a commit message.
                                In addition, a hash is automatically generated to identify your commit. You don&rsquo;t
                                have to care about the hash in the beginning, but later it can be used to jump to
                                specific points in history or to compare commits with each other.</p>

                            <p>The commits happen in your local repository before you eventually &ldquo;push&rdquo; them
                                to the remote repository where they are accessible and visible for everyone. You can
                                accumulate multiple commits locally before you sync them to the remote repository with a
                                push.</p>

                            <p>How would you get your changes from a local repository to the remote repository? There
                                are three essential commands: add, commit, push.</p>

                            <p>First, you can either add all or only selected changed files for the next commit.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">add</span> <span style="color: #e7e9db">.</span>
<span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">add</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">&lt;</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">path</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">to</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">file</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>These files will change their status from unstaged to staged files. You can always verify
                                it with <code>git status</code>. When files are staged, they can be committed. There is
                                also a way back from a staged to an unstaged file.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">reset</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">HEAD</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">&lt;</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">path</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">to</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">file</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>Second, you can commit the staged files with a commit that comes with a commit message.
                                The message describes your change. There are two ways to commit. You can use the
                                shortcut commit command to add the commit message inline:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">commit</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">-</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">m</span> <span style="color: #48b685">&quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>Also you can use the default commit command to make a more elaborated commit message with
                                multi-lines afterward.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">commit</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>The latter command will open up your default command line editor. Usually, the default
                                command line editor is vim. In vim you would type your commit message. Afterward, you
                                can save and exit vim by using <code>:wq</code> which stands for write and quit. Most of
                                the time, you will use the shortcut commit though. It is fast and often an inlined
                                commit message is sufficient.</p>

                            <p>Now, before you get to the third step, multiple commits can accumulate in your local
                                repository. Eventually, in the third step, you would push all the commits in one command
                                to the remote repository.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">push</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">origin</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">master</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>These are the three necessary steps to get your changes from your local repository to the
                                remote repository. But when you collaborate with others, there can be an intermediate
                                step before you push your changes. It can happen that someone else already pushed
                                changes in the remote repository while you made your changes in your local repository.
                                Thus, you would have to pull all the changes from the remote repository before you are
                                allowed to push your own changes. It can be simple as that:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">pull</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">origin</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">master</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>However, I never pull directly. Instead, I pull rebase:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">pull</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">--</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">rebase</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">origin</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">master</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>What&rsquo;s the difference between pull and pull rebase? A basic <code>git pull</code>
                                would simply put all the changes from the remote repository on top of your changes. With
                                a pull rebase, it is the other way around. The changes from the remote repository come
                                first, then your changes will be added on top. Essentially a pull rebase has two
                                benefits:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>it keeps an ordered git history, because your changes are always added last</li>
                                <li>it helps you to resolve conflicts, if you run into them, because you can adjust your
                                    own changes more easily</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>If you have changed but uncommited files when you pull from the remote repository, you
                                are asked to stash your changed files first. After you have pulled all the changes, you
                                can apply the stash again. Stashing will be explained later in the article.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="git-status">Git Status, Log and History</h2>

                            <p>There a three essential git commands that give you a status of your project about current
                                and recent changes. They don&rsquo;t alter anything in your local repository but only
                                show you information. For instance, whenever you want to check the local staged and
                                unstaged changes, type:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">

                            <p>The default <code>git log</code> is not helpful for most people. Each commit takes too
                                much space and it is hard to scan the history. You can use the following configuration
                                to setup a more concise alias:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">config</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">--</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">global</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">alias</span><span style="color: #e7e9db">.</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">lg</span> <span style="color: #48b685">&quot;log --color --graph --pretty=format:&#39;%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)&lt;%an&gt;%Creset&#39; --abbrev-commit&quot;</span>

                            </div>


                            <p>Now you can use it with <code>git lg</code> instead of <code>git log</code>. Try it out
                                to see the difference.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="git-branching">Branching</h2>

                            <p>Git Branches are used for multiple use cases. Imagine you are working on a new feature
                                for your project. You want to open a new branch for it to track the changes
                                independently from the whole project, to be more specific: independently from the master
                                branch. Before you merge the branch into your master branch, you (or others) can review
                                the changes.</p>

                            <p>Another use case is when you work in a team of developers. You want to give everyone the
                                freedom to work independently on improvements, bug fixes and features. Thus, it makes
                                sense to branch out from the master branch for these use cases. <strong>What are the
                                    essential commands for Git branching?</strong> You can either create a new branch on
                                your own:</p>

                            <p>When the branch is newly created by another collaborator and not yet known to your local
                                repository, you can <em>fetch</em> all the branch information from the remote
                                repository. Branches after all are tracked remotely as well. Afterward, you can checkout
                                the branch in your local repository.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">

                            <p>Once you are on the branch, you can pull all the recent changes for it from the remote
                                repository.</p>

                            <p>Now you can start to adjust the code, <code>git add .</code> and <code>git commit</code>
                                them, and push your changes eventually. But rather than pushing them to the master
                                branch, you would push them to the branch.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">

                            <p>That&rsquo;s how you can work on so called feature branches for your project. Other
                                developers can collaborate on these branches and eventually the branches are merged in a
                                Pull Request to the master branch.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="merge-git-pull-request">Merge a Pull Request</h2>

                            <p>At some point, you want to merge a branch to the master branch. You would use the GitHub
                                interface to open a Pull Request (PR) before merging it. Pull Requests help to inspire
                                discussions and peer reviews for an improved code quality and to share knowledge across
                                collaborators.</p>

                            <p>Before opening a PR, I usually follow these steps to checkout the branch, get all the
                                updates to merge them with my own, get all the recent changes from the master branch
                                too, and force push all the changes to the branch itself.</p>

                            <p>First, when being on the master branch, update the master branch to the recent changes:
                            </p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">

                            </div>


                            <p>Second, checkout the branch:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">

</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>If you have not the branch yet, fetch all the branches from the remote repository before
                                and then checkout the branch:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">

                            <p>Third, pull rebase all recent changes from the branch:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">pull</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">--</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">rebase</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">origin</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">&lt;</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">branch</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">&gt;</span>

                            </div>


                            <p>Fourth, rebase all the changes locally from the recent master branch on top:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">rebase</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">master</span>

                            </div>


                            <p>Last but not least, force push all the changes to the remote branch:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">push</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">-</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">f</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">origin</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">&lt;</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">branch</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>The branch is synced with changes from all collaborators, your changes and changes from
                                the master branch. Finally, when the branch is updated in the remote repository, you can
                                hit the &ldquo;Merge Pull Request&rdquo; button on GitHub.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="git-resolve-conflicts">Resolving Conflicts</h2>

                            <p>Sometimes, when you pull the recent changes from a remote repository or when you rebase
                                the master on a branch, you run into conflicts. Conflicts happen when Git cannot resolve
                                multiple changes on the same file. That can happen more often than expected when
                                collaborating with multiple people.</p>

                            <p>For instance, imagine it happens for a <code>git rebase master</code> on your branch. The
                                command line would indicate that it stopped the rebase and shows you the conflicting
                                files. That&rsquo;s no reason to panic. You can open the indicated files and resolve the
                                conflicts. In the file you should see the changes well separated: the changes from
                                master (HEAD) and from your branch (usually the commit message). You have to decide
                                which of both versions you want to take in order to resolve the conflict. After you have
                                resolved all conflicts in all files (usually all files are shown on the command line),
                                you can continue the rebase:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">add</span> <span style="color: #e7e9db">.</span>

</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>If you run again into conflicts, you can resolve them and run the commands again.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="git-stash">Git Stash</h2>

                            <p>A git stash happens usually when you want to throw away changes permanently or temporary.
                            </p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">

</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>The latter, when you want to stash only temporary, can be used when you want to do
                                something else in between. For instance, fixing a bug or creating a PR one
                                someone&rsquo;s behalf.</p>

                            <p>The stash is a heap. You can pick up the latest stash to apply it again to your local
                                repository.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">stash</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">apply</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>If you don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;throw away&rdquo; all changes by stashing, but only
                                selected files, you can use the checkout command instead:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">checkout</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">--</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">&lt;</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">path</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">to</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">file</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>The file goes from unstaged to not changed at all. But remember, whereas stashing allows
                                you to get the stash back from the heap, the checkout reverts all changes in the files.
                                So you are not able to retrieve these changes.</p>

                            <p>Once you merged a Pull Request, you usually want to delete the remote and local branch.

                            <p>While the first command deletes the branch on your local machine, the second command
                                deletes the remote branch on GitHub. It is always good to clean up after you, so you
                                should make this a habit.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="git-interactive-rebase">Interactive Rebase</h2>

                            <p>I must admit, it is not an essential command for Git, but I use it often to organize my
                                commits on a branch. I like to have a tidy branch before I open it as a PR for others.
                                Tidying a branch means to bring commits in an order that makes sense, rewriting commit
                                messages or &ldquo;squashing&rdquo; commit. To squash commits means to merge multiple
                                commits into one.</p>

                            <p>When using an interactive rebase, you can decide how many commits you want to
                                interactively adjust.</p>

                            <p>Afterward, since you adjusted the Git history, you need to force push your changes. A
                                force push will overwrite the Git commits in your remote repository.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">push</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">-</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">f</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">origin</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">master</span>

                            <p>In general, you should be careful with force pushes. A good rule of thumb is that you can
                                do them on a branch, but never on the master branch. In larger projects a force push is
                                often programmatically not allowed on the master branch.</p>

                            </h2>

                            <p>When you collaborate with others or want to have tidy commit messages on your own, you
                                can follow Git commit message conventions. There are a handful of conventions. I am used
                                to follow these that were <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                                    Angular community</a>:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>feat</strong>: A new feature</li>
                                <li><strong>fix</strong>: A bug fix</li>
                                <li><strong>docs</strong>: A documentation change</li>
                                <li><strong>style</strong>: A code style change, doesn&rsquo;t change implementation
                                    details</li>
                                <li><strong>refactor</strong>: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature

                            </ul>

                            <p>They follow this syntax: <code>&lt;type&gt;(&lt;scope&gt;): &lt;subject&gt;</code></p>

                            <p>An example taken from the command line could be:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">commit</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">-</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">m</span> <span style="color: #48b685">&quot;feat(todo-list) add filter feature&quot;</span>

                            <p>That&rsquo;s how you can keep a tidy commit history for yourself but also for your team.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="git-aliases">Git Aliases</h2>

                            <p>Git aliases are used to make up own Git commands by using the built-in Git commands.
                                Aliases allow you to make Git commands more concise or to group them. For instance, you
                                can group two Git commands in order to execute them in one command. That would for
                                example make sense if you wanted to delete a branch. The local and remote deletion would
                                happen in one command. Something like this: <code>git nuke</code>. In another scenario
                                you would abbreviate <code>git pull --rebase</code> with <code>gpr</code>.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="git-pull-requests-issues">Pull Requests vs. Issues</h2>

                            <p>Pull Requests (PR) and Issues are used in collaboration with multiple people.</p>

                            <p>When someone in your team created a new branch to work independently on a feature, the
                                branch will lead to a PR eventually. A PR can be reviewed by other collaborators on
                                GitHub. You can have discussions, reviews and have the option to merge or close the PR.
                            </p>

                            <p>An issue is mostly opened before a branch and PR is created. The issue states a problem
                                in the project and stimulates a discussion. The conversation can lead to a specification
                                that can be used as blueprint to implement a solution. Therefore, you would create a PR
                                based on the Issue. Issues can be labeled to keep track of different categories of
                                issues.</p>

                            <p>Finally, it is also possible to use PRs and Issues in a private, single person
                                repository. Even when you work on your own, you can use these feature of GitHub to keep
                                better track of problems and changes.</p>

                            <hr class="section-divider">

                            <p>These GitHub and Git essentials should be everything you need to get started in this
                                area. You shouldn&rsquo;t feel intimidated by the setup nor by the commands. After all,
                                the commands break down to several atomic ones that can be used in only a few essential
                                scenarios.</p>

                            <p>The essential Git commands break down to:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>git init</li>
                                <li>git clone</li>
                                <li>git add</li>
                                <li>git commit</li>
                                <li>git push</li>
                                <li>git pull &ndash;rebase</li>
                                <li>git fetch</li>
                                <li>git status</li>
                                <li>git log (git lg)</li>
                                <li>git diff</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Obviously, there are more Git commands (git bisect, git reflog, &hellip;) that you could
                                master. However, I don&rsquo;t find myself using them very often. You can look these up,
                                once you need them, before you have to memorize them. After all, in most cases you will
                                more likely lookup the issue you want to solve in Git rather than a specific command.
                                Most of these issues in Git are well explained when you search for them.</p>
