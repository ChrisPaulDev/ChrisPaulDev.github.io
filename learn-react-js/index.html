                                    survey</a> has shown that many developers are content with React for creating modern
                                web applications. However, due to its popularity and job demand, there are still many
                                JavaScript developers who want to learn React. In this guide, I want to give beginners a
                                comprehensive overview of how to approach learning React without getting distracted or
                                overwhelmed by other topics along the way.</p>
                            <h1 id="learn-react-quickly-fast-easy">Learn React [Quickly || Fast || Easy]</h1>
                            <p>There is no way to learn something the easy way. You have to be patient. That applies for
                                developers too. Personally, that&rsquo;s why I like being a developer, because there
                                will be always something new to learn. If you stay curious, you will not be disappointed
                                while becoming a developer. Learning is always a challenge, <a
                                    href="../lessons-learned-deep-work-flow/index.html">a challenge to hone your skills,
                                    if challenge and skill at hand are in balance</a>. That&rsquo;s why it takes time to
                                learn React as well.</p>
                            <p>However, React has not a steep learning curve when following one simple rule: Learn
                                React, <strong>only React step by step</strong>, and don&rsquo;t let yourself distract
                                from other tech on this journey. JavaScript and React are evolving constantly, because
                                both stay innovative and want to stay relevant in the future too; so learn and keep up
                                with them first before learning anything else on top of it. I have heard success stories
                                from developers who went from not knowing React to getting offered a React job at a
                                company from a few days to a few months. On the job they got the chance to learn more
                                about all the other fancy technologies that come along with React.</p>

                            <p>There are a couple of tech stacks that people want to learn with React straightaway. I
                                want to pick up a few of them and give a brief explanation why it isn&rsquo;t a good
                                idea to marry them with React while learning it:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Learn React with TypeScript?</strong> No way, learn React first before
                                        converting JavaScript to a typed language. Not only the vanilla JavaScript code
                                        will be typed with TypeScript, but also your React components and everything
                                        that comes with them. It will become a mess and overwhelming when you
                                        haven&rsquo;t learned React itself from scratch. Also 99% of the React tutorials
                                        and courses out there are not written in TypeScript, so it makes things more
                                        complicated than easier.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Learn React with Redux?</strong> Redux is a popular state management
                                        library for JavaScript. Again, learn React and its built-in state management
                                        first before reaching out to a sophisticated external state management library
                                        which is meant to be used in large scale and complex applications. React already
                                        comes with plenty of tools to handle state in your application. The vast
                                        majority of React applications out there doesn&rsquo;t even need Redux or any
                                        other state management library. Learn how to deal with the state in React first
                                        before throwing another library on the problem. Redux makes React more
                                        complicated for beginners.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p><strong>Learn React with Gatsby?</strong> Gatsby.js got quite popular in the
                                        recent time. It&rsquo;s the go-to solution for creating static websites such as
                                        personal websites, blogs and landing pages. However, Gatsby comes with its own
                                        learnings such as GraphQL, its large plugin system, and the problems coming with
                                        server-side rendered React applications. So don&rsquo;t mistake Gatsby.js for
                                        having an easier time learning React. It makes writing static websites with
                                        React easier, but not learning React itself.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These were only a few things React beginners tend to associate with React when starting
                                out with it. There are definitely more of them. However, they will not make the learning
                                experience easier. In contrast, you will have to learn two things instead of one. So
                                start out with React first before learning anything on top of it. Learn <a

                            <p>Since React is a JS library, there is no way around learning JavaScript. You cannot learn
                                React without JavaScript or without knowing JavaScript in the first place. In comparison
                                to other frontend solutions, React makes heavily use of JavaScript.</p>
                            <h2 id="learn-react-or-javascript-first">Learn React or JavaScript first?</h2>
                            <p>You should understand at least the basics of JavaScript, often referred to as JavaScript
                                ES5, and have decent knowledge about HTML and CSS. React also utilizes JavaScript
                                syntax, most often referred to JavaScript ES6 and beyond (ES7, ES8, ES9). That&rsquo;s
                                why it makes sense to get comfortable with at least <a

                            <p>There are many people who recommend to learn web development and <em>all</em> JavaScript
                                fundamentals as prerequisite before learning React. The skills they recommend to acquire
                                go far beyond what&rsquo;s needed to build basic applications with React.js. A couple of
                                them may be:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript</li>
                                <li>bind(), apply(), and call()</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>However, I believe it&rsquo;s not true to have all this knowledge. In contrast, it can be
                                very disillusioning for beginners being new to JavaScript, React and Web Development.
                                You don&rsquo;t want to hang around in the &ldquo;Scopes and Closures&rdquo;-land while
                                you could build real projects instead that motivate you to keep going. The
                                &ldquo;Aha&rdquo;-moment for grasping closures will come along the way. Personally I
                                didn&rsquo;t know about half of the things in the list when I started to learn React and
                                I still have to look up regular expressions online because I don&rsquo;t really bother
                                learning them; <a href="../work-with-me/index.html">and I still help companies with
                                    their JavaScript projects</a>.</p>
                            <p>I believe <strong>most of JavaScript can be learned along the way when learning
                                    React</strong>, because then you experience it in context while building web
                                applications. That&rsquo;s exciting and that&rsquo;s what drives us as human beings. So
                                keep yourself excited while learning and don&rsquo;t hang around too long with the
                                fundamentals where you cannot see the purpose without ever applying them in a real world
                                scenario. Start to build real projects. Stay curious! Move forth and back between
                                JavaScript and React while you learn React.</p>

                            <p>Historically <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery">jQuery</a> filled the gap between
                                vanilla JavaScript and modern libraries/frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.
                                Early JavaScript wasn&rsquo;t as efficient in the browser and other subjects as it is
                                nowadays. That&rsquo;s why there was a real need for jQuery. However, modern JavaScript
                                is capable of dealing with all the things itself. Hence my recommendation: Don&rsquo;t
                                bother about jQuery.</p>
                            <p>If you are working on a larger application that utilizes React at your new job, it is
                                likely to be confronted with jQuery in the application&rsquo;s legacy areas. But
                                it&rsquo;s okay to not being proficient with jQuery then and just look up online what
                                you need to get the job done. As alternative, try to migrate the code from jQuery to
                                React instead as a learning opportunity. That&rsquo;s how I did it in my last job,
                                because I became a JavaScript developer in the early days of Angular, but never really
                                had to learn jQuery to a degree of being proficient with it. Instead I focused on the <a

                            <p>Why do you want to learn React in the first place? Beginners know about all the shiny
                                modern libraries in JavaScript but often don&rsquo;t ask themselves why they need them.
                                They may only know that they are in huge demand by companies and jobs. However,
                                sometimes it makes sense to backpedal to the question: <em>Why do I need this?</em></p>
                            <p>It doesn&rsquo;t only apply to React, but to all the other libraries and frameworks you
                                will learn in your life as a developer. What problem does it solve for me? Too often
                                people throw libraries on top of their tech stack without experiencing the problem in
                                the first place. That&rsquo;s why I believe it is a great learning experience to <a

                                with the recent changes, is not biased, teaches you everything the React way, and is put
                                together by the React core team and the React community in your interest.</p>
                            <h2 id="learn-with-react-docs">Learn with React Docs</h2>
                            <p>Being referred to the documentation of a library as a beginner in web development can be
                                intimidating. But I strongly believe it&rsquo;s the best way to learn something new. On
                                your career path to becoming a developer, you will get used to learn new things with the
                                documentation of the new thing, so why not get used to it now? It comes with certain
                                benefits to learn documentation driven:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>beginner tutorial</li>
                                <li>no commercial interest</li>
                                <li>opinionated way of doing things</li>
                                <li>thoughtfully put together by core contributors and community</li>
                                <li>latest material and updates for new versions</li>
                                <li>API references</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Every time I pick up a new tech, I don&rsquo;t check any courses or books, I go straight
                                to the tech&rsquo;s documentation and check whether there is a beginner tutorial. Often
                                there is one and that&rsquo;s my entry point into a new world. From there, I can always
                                check for other learning material, but my starting point will always be the official
                                documentation of the new thing I intend to learn. After all, that&rsquo;s why I write my
                                tutorials and books in close relation to the documentation by always refereing it in my
                                guides. That&rsquo;s how beginners learn to use the documentation and that&rsquo;s what
                                will make them more efficient and effecrtive when learning a new tech in the future.</p>

                            <p>After you went through the React beginner tutorial from the React documentation and
                                learned the basics of React from scratch, continue learning by building a project
                                yourself before learning any other tech. It&rsquo;s not always simple to <a
                                    href="../how-to-learn-framework/index.html">come up with project ideas</a>, but
                                there is plenty of inspiration out there.</p>
                            <p>For instance, there are also people who want to learn React by <a target="_blank"

                                I guess you will find plenty of React Tic Tac Toe implementations out there. Implement
                                the game in React yourself and compare your solution to the other solutions. You will
                                learn from your mistakes and learn to evaluate your source code against the
                                implementation by others.</p>

                            <p>Learn React by doing is one of the most common recommendations you will get to hear from
                                other developers, it applies to almost everything in life, because every task will
                                present you with a new challenge to grow as a React developer. Also it is too easy to
                                passively consume video courses, books, and tutorials. Get your hands dirty and
                                implement something yourself. Get stuck with a problem, become desperate, ponder over
                                the problem by taking time off the screen, solve the problem eventually, and reap the
                                fruits of it. That&rsquo;s the basic framework of learning anything.</p>

                                Only when sticking to it for a while, by having the persistence and by coding every day,
                                you will eventually become a React developer. It&rsquo;s a marathon and not a sprint.

                            <p>The best way to learn something new is to learn it in public. Confront yourself with the
                                feedback from other React developers by showing off your achievements. If you have
                                reached a milestone with your React project, show it to others and ask for their
                                feedback. These are a couple of commonly known platforms to share ideas around React:
                            </p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>You will not only get feedback from people there, but also dive more into React by
                                joining discussions. Be part of the community. Another great way to learn something new
                                yourself is to explain it to someone else. Maybe you are one step ahead of a fellow
                                React beginner and can help them out. Checkout the <em>React Beginner Thread</em> in the
                                <em>React Subreddit</em> where you can help fellow React developers to solve their
                                problems.</p>
                            <h2 id="learn-to-use-react">Learn to use React</h2>
                            <p>After you went through the beginner tutorial in React&rsquo;s docs and started to
                                implement a React project yourself, learn to use React with all its facets. React has
                                only a slim API surface area, so try to get proficient with it.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Learn about React&rsquo;s JSX syntax</li>
                                <li>Learn about React Components</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Learn and understand React. In the end, it doesn&rsquo;t need much to create a React
                                component that returns JSX, to use a React component in another React component while
                                arranging them in a component hierarchy, to pass data from component to component with
                                props, and to make components interactive with state. That&rsquo;s the gist of React.
                                Learn React in depth by applying your learned skills in your project and not by
                                consuming endless of content.</p>

                                develop React applications on your local machine, checkout these MacOS and Windows Setup
                                Guides to make it work on your machine:</p>

                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Execute JavaScript with Node and NPM:</strong> While Node.js makes it
                                    possible to run JavaScript outside of the browser, NPM (node package manager) allows
                                    you to install libraries like React to your project. You will need both tools for
                                    almost any other modern JavaScript project as well.</li>
                                <li><strong>Develop with Visual Studio Code:</strong> A popular lightweight IDE that is
                                    the go-to solution for React developers. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) comes with an
                                    editor to learn React development and a terminal (command line) to start your React
                                    project and install libraries for it.</li>
                                <li><strong>Learn with create-react-app:</strong> The go-to solution from Facebook and
                                    the React team to get you started with a lightweight and zero-configuration React
                                    starter project. 99% of the React tutorials out there build up on top of this
                                    starter project to get you started with React. You can focus only on learning React
                                    while all the toolings around it are taken care of by create-react-app.</li>
                                <li><strong>Format with Prettier:</strong> Opinionated code formatter that automatically
                                    formats your code in your development environment. It comes with a straightforward
                                    setup and integrations for popular editors (VS Code). While you learn React web
                                    development, it shows you how to format your React code.</li>

                            <p>After you have learned the basics of React with React components, props/state, and
                                React&rsquo;s JSX syntax to return valid HTML in JavaScript, you can dive deeper with
                                advanced React concepts and patterns. These are a few essential of them that will not go
                                away that quickly:</p>

                            <p>Being equipped with these advanced React techniques, you should be comfortable to dive
                                into larger React applications where you will find these concepts and techniques more
                                often. Due to React Hooks, the other Higher-Order Components and Render Prop Components
                                may be less used in the future, but you should still see them fairly often throughout
                                the next year.</p>

                            <p>After you went through React&rsquo;s documentation to learn about the basics and a few
                                advanced concepts and patterns, and after you have started to build a React application
                                yourself, definitely checkout other React resources online. Note that I mention this
                                very late in this guide, because often React beginners are stuck in a never ending story
                                of just consuming content to learn React. The thing I want to point out: Start to
                                produce by developing React applications yourself or by writing about your learnings.
                                Learning by doing is the key here. Every problem along the way can be looked up online.
                                And then if you want to learn more about React, checkout all the other resources to
                                learn React online. My recommendation is to not only consume one kind of learning
                                material, but to diversify your learning resources:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>React Tutorials</li>
                                <li>React Books</li>
                                <li>React Videos (YouTube, Twitch, Online Courses)</li>
                                <li>Web Development or React Podcasts</li>
                                <li>Interactive Courses</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>However, not every kind of learning material may suit you. The same applies to the
                                teaching styles of the people behind the larning material. Everyone has a different way
                                to produce content and to offer it to their students, so checkout which teaching style

                                <p><em>&ldquo;Initially, when first approaching React, I had purchased a Udemy course
                                        from another teacher. However, I found myself getting quite lost after just a
                                        few videos. The teacher in that highly rated series kept it easy at first but
                                        then blindsides you with hard to grasp concepts and code and failed to inform
                                        well what was going on.</em> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                            <p>If you are into reading, checkout online tutorials and React books. Print books are a
                                good resources to learn React offline as well. Even though many people are afraid that
                                books get outdated too quickly, I can only argue that most books are self-published and
                                it takes the author only 1 day to have a new version of it online (even on Amazon). I
                                believe it takes longer to update a video than written content nowadays.</p>
                            <p>If you are into watching, checkout online courses by individual developers on YouTube,
                                Udemy and their own course platforms. However, again don&rsquo;t get stuck in only
                                watching the content. Find content where you are forced to apply your learnings.</p>
                            <p>If you just want to keep up with recent React news, Podcasts are a great way to stay
                                ahead of the curve. You will listen to developers being on the bleeding edge of the
                                technology who always release something new to learn. Also Podcasts are a great way to
                                keep learning React while commuting or while exercising in the gym. That&rsquo;s how I
                                do it at least.</p>
                            <p>There are plenty of free React learning resources online that have a high quality and are
                                accessible to everyone. If anyone asks me about becoming a React developer, I often just
                                send them straightaway to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>. Regardless of which learning
                                resource you pick, try to stay pragmatic by applying the learnings yourself. Don&rsquo;t
                                just passively consume the content. Be active and challenge yourself to hone your
                                skills.</p>
