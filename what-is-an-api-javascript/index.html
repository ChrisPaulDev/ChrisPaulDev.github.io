                            <p>It might be a common issue in teaching computer science at universities: While you learn
                                about bubble sorts, lambda calculus and permutations, nobody mentors you about common
                                developer subjects. In the early days at university, I often wondered: <em>What is an
                                    API?</em></p>

                            <p>Not everyone is fully aware of it, but APIs follow us through a multitude of programming
                                contexts. They surround us. When I take you on the journey of how I got to know the API,
                                you may get the idea what I mean by using APIs unconsciously most of the time. They give
                                you an interface ranging from remote services, components in a web application to
                                sensors in mobile devices. Interfaces are all around us.</p>

                            <p>However, there is a knowledge gap when it comes to APIs. It starts when teaching
                                programming. Teachers assume that APIs are common knowledge. The abbreviation pops up in
                                tutorials, courses and books without any introduction. But it isn&rsquo;t common ground
                                that teachers try to build on. Everyone is referring to this mysterious API, but nobody
                                explains what it really is. My own articles about learning programming are not excluded
                                from this flaw. That&rsquo;s why I want to take you on this journey of mine when I got
                                to know APIs.</p>

                            <p>The article is my attempt to take you on a journey by giving you an introduction to APIs.
                                Rather than giving you a technical Wikipedia reference, this journey attempts to wrap
                                the subject of APIs into a story that I experienced myself when I studied computer
                                science. The journey shows how a multitude of concrete fragments, like APIs in different
                                programming contexts, can become something abstract, like interoperability between
                                entities, in the end. If you are curious how to convey this information in JavaScript
                                afterward, checkout the great blog post by Tania Rascia: <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/">How to
                                    Connect to an API with JavaScript</a>.</p>

                            <p>Apart from the introduction to APIs, the journey might also give you insights into other
                                topics: studying computer science, the general struggle and clumsiness when learning
                                programming and the experience of perceiving the bigger picture eventually.</p>

                            <p>Hopefully, the journey makes a good story that along the way introduces you to APIs and
                                the empowering feeling that comes with them.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="apisAndDocumentation">Baby Steps towards APIs and
                                Documentations</h2>

                            <p>When I started to study computer science, everyone was euphoric about the first hands-on
                                coding course. Personally, I had no background in programming at all. I felt that
                                everyone else in the room was way more experienced. What I didn&rsquo;t know: They were
                                just as clueless as I was. At least most of them.</p>

                            <p>The course was about creating and controlling a Lego Mindstorms robot. After coming up
                                with teams that had to be maintained during the course, as you can imagine, people were
                                rushing with their ideas and implementations. It was intimidating for people without any
                                background in programming. Even more when you are an introverted person. After all, you
                                had to come along with your peers during the next months in the course. You didn&rsquo;t
                                want to be the one who couldn&rsquo;t contribute anything at all.</p>

                            <p>A handful of older students taught the class in successive sessions controlling the
                                robot. It happened often that they referred to an API when people asked questions.
                                Referring to the API became the default answer.</p>

                            <p>However, I wasn&rsquo;t aware of what they meant with an API. Even when I finally asked
                                for an explanation, the answer didn&rsquo;t help me at all. It was too abstract at this
                                time. Obviously, it didn&rsquo;t help to read the Wikipedia article about APIs. I missed
                                something concrete.</p>

                            <p>Initially, I thought the API is sort of a manual, or documentation one would say, to read
                                about the functionalities of the robot. Because when the teaching students referenced
                                the API, the learning students would always open up this cheatsheet of commands.</p>

                            <p>I was taught to be wrong with my assumption. The documentation only describes the API:
                                How to use it and what to expect in return when using it. The API itself is the
                                programming interface of the robot. The kind of things you need to execute in your code
                                that something happens: class methods, functions. In fact, the API was the interface of
                                the robot: How I could make it move, read the light sensor and play audio like the theme
                                of Star Wars.</p>

                            <p>In a future course, I learned that a documentation of an API is not mandatory. Often, you
                                can only read the source code that is behind an API to understand its functionalities.
                                In one course, we collaborated with a Spanish university. We had to translate the
                                documentation for a library from Spanish to English before we were able to use it. Even
                                the source code of the library we had to use was in Spanish.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="packages">Packages, Libraries, Modules - Woot?</h2>

                            <p>Eventually, I found out that these functionalities, that I used to control the robot, are
                                somewhere hidden inside packages. The word package was used in a range of synonyms. They
                                would have been referred as modules or libraries. It was difficult to untangle this
                                abstract mess.</p>

                            <p>After all, these functionalities were grouped somewhere yet hidden. I couldn&rsquo;t see
                                how these were implemented, yet it was sufficient to call a function to make something
                                happen.</p>

                            <p>I am not sure when I had this infamous &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment, maybe not even during
                                the Lego Mindstorms course, but at some point I grasped that these packages, that I
                                imported to access functionalities, were libraries.</p>

                            <p>At a later point during my university time, we were introduced properly to Java.
                                Suddenly, a lot of things from the Lego Mindstorms course made sense. Even though no one
                                mentioned APIs anymore.</p>

                            <p>In this course, we were introduced to the paradigm of object-oriented programming paired
                                with syntax and patterns in Java. There were these packages again. They could be public,
                                protected or private. To be fair, yes, they can also be package-private. But teaching
                                these is not my goal in this article. The point is that these are <a target="_blank"

                                    href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html">access
                                    level modifiers</a> in Java. They give you permissions to use functionalities from
                                external places to the source code. Functionalities from classes. Functionalities from
                                packages that bundle multiple classes. Basically they described the access level of the
                                API. But nobody used the term API to describe those things in a practical use case. They
                                were access level modifiers.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="jQuery">Meeting the $</h2>

                            <p>No, it was not about cash :) It was about jQuery. The first time I used jQuery was in a
                                web development course teaching JavaScript in HTML. I must admit that the $ object
                                confused me and I still wonder if others feel the same when they meet the object the
                                first time. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to simply name it jQuery instead of $? I have
                                often mistaken the $ for a language specific syntax rather than an object coming from
                                the jQuery library. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t perceive jQuery as a library in the
                                first place, but as well integrated thing in the JavaScript language.</p>

                            <p>The course went straight into jQuery to manipulate DOM nodes without using the native
                                browser API at all. Yes, the browser has an API as well. To be more specific, there are
                                different APIs. For instance, one of it is the API for the DOM. You can use the document
                                object to access your HTML, to traverse through it and to manipulate it. By substituting
                                the native DOM API with jQuery in an early developer&rsquo;s career, no one ended up
                                learning the basics.</p>

                            <p>Again, similar like the Java packages, I didn&rsquo;t perceive these functionalities of a
                                library like jQuery or the native DOM as APIs at this point in time. But they would end
                                up as two more concrete fragments to the greater picture of APIs.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="distributedSystems">One Course to rule them all: Distributed
                                Systems</h2>

                            <p>After two years of computer science, I was still not convinced that I wanted to continue
                                studying. I learned different theoretical and practical things but never got hooked. I
                                was missing the bigger picture of it. Instead, I devoted most of my time to video and <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://soundcloud.com/schlenkermitturnbeutel">audio</a> things.</p>

                            <p>However, there was this one course that changed everything for me. It connected all the
                                dots. Suddenly it made all these practical things I learned previously relevant, because
                                I could use them altogether.</p>

                            <p>The course was about distributed systems. It was empowering to get to know all the
                                benefits that you get from a distributed system. Before, I was clueless about the
                                possibilities in programming. However, this course changed everything because it gave me
                                empowering moments. It opened up opportunities.</p>

                            <p>The course introduced us to different theoretical and practical things to enable
                                distributed systems. Distributed systems are systems that are connected in a remote way.
                                They can communicate to each other. In the course, these systems were often referred to
                                as web services.</p>

                            <p>Suddenly, I could have a web service communicating to another web service. Even though
                                both were physically not at the same place. One web service accessing another one would
                                be the client. The consumed web service would be the server. But the best thing was that
                                a client web service could be a server for another client web service again. That was
                                one of this empowering moments I experienced. It would be a web of functionalities
                                distributed somewhere yet accessed by APIs.</p>

                            <p>The main focus of the course was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> that is a protocol on top of
                                HTTP. It allows the communication between remote web services. I hope that the course
                                changed the content by now, because SOAP seemed already to be dying back at the time. I
                                am not even sure if that is true, but I never saw a SOAP powered web service after my
                                time at university.</p>

                            <p>Fortunately, another 10% of the course taught <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>. It is
                                not a protocol like SOAP, but an architectual style that uses HTTP. It doesn&rsquo;t
                                reinvent the wheel and uses standardized technologies to enable web services
                                communicating with each other via HTTP.</p>

                            <p>But REST wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be the silver bullet. Whereas SOAP would have been used
                                to expose functionalities, REST was intended to expose resources. Resources that you
                                might know as a list of todo items, authors or comments that would be fetched from a
                                server. Nowadays, RESTful services, services that follow the REST paradigm, are often
                                missused. For instance, it can happen by exposing functionalities rather than resources.
                                In most of the cases they don&rsquo;t follow all the principles of REST. They are more
                                RESTish than RESTful.</p>

                            <p>But let&rsquo;s leave this topic for another time.</p>

                            <p>In my course, when the final decision had to be made in which paradigm my team of two
                                would implement a web service, we fortunately decided in favor of REST. In modern web
                                applications, RESTful services are commonly used as a standardized way to implement
                                client-server-communication.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="distributedSystemsAftermath">Implementing a Distributed
                                System: The Aftermath</h2>

                            <p>Did I mention that distributed systems were empowering? Did I mention that it connected
                                all the dots of practical things I learned before?</p>

                            <p>Suddenly I was able to create remote services that expose functionalities or resources
                                and could be consumed from other services that were physically somewhere else. In our
                                team of two, we built a client-server-architecture that was powered by Java on both
                                ends. We used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wicket">Wicket</a> for the client
                                application and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jersey">Jersey</a> to establish a REST
                                interface, an API that could be consumed from the client, for the backend application.
                            </p>

                            <p>That&rsquo;s not even the whole truth. In the beginning, we used plain Java to connect
                                client and server via HTTP. Eventually, we figured out that there were librares in Java
                                that solved this issue already. We ended up to use the Jersey library to avoid the
                                boilerplate. It was one of the times when you had to implement something the hard way,
                                experiencing the problem on your own, and had the possibility to substitute it by a
                                solution that was already out there. The solution, a library, would be accessed by its
                                very own API again. A library, with an API, to build an API.</p>

                            <p>Because these web services were decoupled by using a standardized communication channel,
                                they didn&rsquo;t had to be Java on both ends. That was another great thing to know
                                about. Suddenly I would be able to connect a JavaScript frontend with a Java backend
                                application. Another empowerment along the way that was enabled due APIs.</p>

                            <h3 id="third-party-apis">Third-Party APIs</h3>

                            <p>I didn&rsquo;t know that other platforms offered public APIs. However, it seemed like
                                everyone else in the course, except for me and my partner, knew about it. It led the
                                other teams to implement only a client-side application whereas my team built a full
                                blown client-server-architecture. Now you have to see this in the context of our naivety
                                yet curiosity. We spent a lot of time during these 4 months building the application. In
                                the aftermath, I am grateful for it, because I learned a lot by building this
                                application.</p>

                            <p>The principle of third-party APIs was another learning experience that had a lasting
                                impact. Even though the client-server-architecture was distributed, I never thought
                                about giving someone else access to the server by making the API public. However, again
                                it was just mind blowing. It was that feeling of empowerment, being able to build
                                functionalities that others could access remotely.</p>

                            <h3 id="the-facade">The Facade</h3>

                            <p>I don&rsquo;t remember how we found out about the pattern, but suddenly we had a Facade
                                in our server application. It is a programming pattern that groups functionalities in an
                                interface object to make it accessible to the outside. In plain English, the
                                implementation was just an interface that hid all the implementation details behind
                                functions. However, it grouped these functionalities with purpose.</p>

                            <p>That was the point when we realized the RESTful service had an API. Similar to a browser
                                with its native APIs, a library like jQuery, Wicket or Jersey, or your own implemented
                                packages in Java. But this time it was an API to a remote entity.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="royFielding">A deep dive into REST with Roy T. Fielding</h2>

                            <p>Due to this impactful experience of distributed system, I devoted my Bachelor thesis to
                                the REST paradigm. After all, it was the topic that kept me hooked to computer science
                                in the context of distributed systems.</p>

                            <p>I consumed everything I could find about the topic. It was still mysterious though. What
                                does it mean that REST is an abstract architecture while SOAP is a concrete protocol?
                                Everything about REST had to be laid down in front of me in order to process it piece by
                                piece. I decided to read Roy T. Fieldings foundational thesis about REST.</p>

                            <p>There it was again: This paralyzing feeling of empowerment yet being overwhelmed.
                                Principles in REST like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                                hooked me completely.</p>

                            <p>A RESTful service is stateless? Wow, that means I would be able to use multiple services
                                and distribute the server load among multiple instances. Another missing building block
                                for my knowledge gaps. The biggest mystery was the authentification with a RESTful
                                service. How should it be handled when the server is stateless? How does the server
                                remember my session? I found out: It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

                            <p>In my Bachelor thesis I made the straight forward attempt to compare different solutions
                                that enable RESTful architectures in Java. I ended up comparing Jersey, RESTEasy and
                                Restlet, libraries that enable you to build RESTful APIs, under the requirements of the
                                offifical standardization <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services">JAX-RS</a>.
                                In addition, I compared their well doing under the light of the next generation of
                                JAX-RS 2.0.</p>

                            <p>I guess every programmer would have said that it is a useless attempt to compare these
                                libraries based on the standardization. However, personally it was a great learning
                                exercise. It again taught me more in the fields of APIs. When comparing and implementing
                                a RESTful service with three different libraries, you get to know the fine-grained
                                differences. I was able to get to know the constraints of each library. I was able to
                                get a feeling about good and bad API design. In addition, I could evaluate the
                                constraints compared to an official standardization.</p>

                            <p>Leaving the topic of distributed systems, I want to thank my teacher, who had this
                                lasting impact by lecturing distributed systems and for giving me the chance to write my
                                Bachelor thesis about this topic.</p>

                                became a popular topic. Everything I learned before came together in both subjects. It
                                was about accessing sensors of a mobile device, using libraries such as Ember to build a
                                sophisticated single page application, designing own interfaces for Angular components,
                                and gathering data from third-party platforms. I even built an own windows phone app in
                                my spare time which consumed an open API of a popular platform. Everything by using
                                APIs.</p>

                            <p>After my experience with distributed systems, I started to code in my free time. Suddenly
                                I was able to build things. I was not limited to a dull sandbox anymore. Applications
                                were able to communicate with third-party platforms, sensors and libraries. They could
                                communicate with each other. Larger libraries turned out to be frameworks, yet they were
                                consumed the same as a library by using an API.</p>

                            <p>I can only guess, but I assume that a lot of developers are unaware of using APIs all the
                                time. Still, these things empower developers. Otherwise, developers would never be able
                                to leave the sandbox. When leaving the sandbox, you can communicate with code from
                                others, access their functionalities, retrieve resources from them or manipulate
                                resources.</p>

                            <p>In addition, people are unaware when designing and implementing APIs themselves. It
                                already happens when you implement a component in React or Angular. Be aware, that your
                                peers are going to use it eventually.</p>

                            <p>I call it the unconscious act of using and implementing APIs.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="apiSummary">Hello, API!</h2>

                            <p>APIs are the programming interfaces to applications. <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple</a> APIs are
                                thoughtfully and well designed. They follow constraints and don&rsquo;t monkey-patch or
                                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading">overload</a>
                                functionalities.</p>

                            <p>When learning programming, at some point concrete fragments, that are learned over time,
                                create an abstraction. Suddenly, what Wikipedia said about APIs makes sense. The bigger
                                picture unfolds in front of you. However, it takes time and concreteness in the
                                fragments over the course of learning. In the case of an API, you suddenly become aware
                                of the interoperability of systems and the contexts of using APIs:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>the DOM API in the browser</li>
                                <li>the sensors in your smartphone</li>
                                <li>the remote web service</li>
                                <li>the library or framework in your web application</li>
                                <li>the packages in your Java application</li>
                                <li>the component in your React, Angular or Vue application</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Everyone should be aware of it. Everyone is unconsciously an API architect. Eventually,
                                others have to use your functionalities. Design and implement it thoughtfully. Keep it
                                lightweight, simple to use and with clear constraints. That&rsquo;s what makes your API
                                durable over time.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="apiToTeachLearn">APIs are Concrete: They help to learn yet to
                                teach</h2>

                            <p>Through my journey at university, I learned programming with APIs. Distributed systems
                                was the subject that kept me learning programming. By using APIs with concrete examples,
                                be it the browser API, a third-party library or a remote RESTful service accessed by its
                                API, you can use these concrete examples to learn. I found it highly empowering, leaving
                                my sandbox in order to learn programming. You get the real world content from others to
                                experiment with.</p>

                            <p>After reflecting on this topic of APIs, I try to use them to teach programming. Consider
                                a third-party platform that has an API to access its resources. Rather than leaving
                                students bored by having them to push around arbitrary data, you can give them access to
                                real world data. I use this concept of teaching programming with third-party platforms
                                often. Yes, you run into problems with changing APIs, but you still empower your
                                students. I use this principle in my <a
                                    href="../the-road-to-learn-react/index.html">book to teach the fundamentals of
                                    React</a>.</p>

                            <p>In the end, I hope that the article didn&rsquo;t come along to blame the university,
                                teachers or anyone. In the contrary, the journey supported me a lot to digest all the
                                smaller building blocks. When learning programming everything seems to be so far away.
                                When teaching people you need concrete examples that are not buried under abstractions.
                                Still, a beginner can easily get overwhelmed by all the noise burying the important
                                topics. You can feel paralyzed by it. But you can fight this effect by using concrete
                                examples to teach and learn programming. APIs are a great example to empower students.
