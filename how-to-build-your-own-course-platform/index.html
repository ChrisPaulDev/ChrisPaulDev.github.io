                            <p>Recently, I built <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://roadtoreact.com/">my own course platform</a> to teach students and
                                professionals about web development. The courses on the platform are teaching about
                                React and its ecosystem, but I want to generalize the platform&rsquo;s implementation in
                                the future. It should be reusable for for other educational domains too. The platform
                                launch came along with the release of my second course, <a
                                    href="../learn-react-redux-mobx-state-management/index.html">Taming the State in
                                    React</a>, and therefore was the perfect playground to experiment with it. In the
                                following article, I want to give you a huge brain dump of mine about why I built my own
                                course platform, what I used to accomplish it, what challenges I faced, and what
                                decisions I had to make along the way. The article might give you a couple of valuable
                                insights into launching your own platform. I am definitely not an expert in this domain,
                                because I just try to document my own learnings on my website. If you have any advice
                                for me, feel free to reach out :-)</p>
                            <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> It takes a lot of effort and energy, but it is a challenging
                                experience which broadens your skill set and enables you to learn new things along the
                                way.</p>
                            <p>So why did I decide to build my own course platform in the first place? I know that there
                                are various alternatives such as Udemy and Teachable out there. So what&rsquo;s the
                                motivation behind building your own course platform?</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Learning:</strong> I wanted to build an own platform to face all the
                                        challenges when shipping an own product. A lot of these challenges are explained
                                        in the following article. They didn&rsquo;t only challenge my abilities to code
                                        (which wasn&rsquo;t the hardest part), but also in challenging myself by
                                        creating, launching and advertising a product.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p><strong>Independence:</strong> The reasoning behind it is the same as for having
                                        an own website with an own domain rather than hosting your content on
                                        third-party platforms or using their third-party APIs. You never know how long
                                        these platforms survive, you never know how far the vendor lock-in reaches and
                                        you will have a hard time to transfer your audience to another platform
                                        eventually.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Tailored Solution:</strong> I wanted to have an own platform for my
                                        content where I am able to make all the fine-grained decisions. I didn&rsquo;t
                                        want to be restricted by a third-party platform. I didn&rsquo;t want to
                                        integrate with the services another platform might suggest or any course
                                        structure which is recommend by it. For instance, since my content evolved
                                        around ebooks so far, I wanted to have an option to download these in different
                                        formats. Afterward, it should still be possible to offer links to source code
                                        projects for exciting applications or to give access to screencasts series to
                                        supplement the learning experience.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Pricing &amp; Fees:</strong> Many third-party platforms come with a
                                        membership pricing model or/and high fees when your course is sold. I wanted to
                                        avoid both by having an own platform. I wanted to cut out most of the middlemen
                                        when selling a course. It is similar to self-publishing an ebook rather than
                                        having a dedicated publisher for it. In addition, I can choose the third-party
                                        services that are integrated in my platform based on my needs, their pricing and
                                        features, and an effortless integration. I would only pay the services that are
                                        needed for my course platform and only the payment gateways would apply a fee
                                        for every payment that goes through them.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Experiencing the Journey:</strong> It was always a milestone in my life
                                        to have a product one day that goes beyond an informational product such as an
                                        ebook or course. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to build a platform around my
                                        educational content. It would grow my abilities by facing all the challenges
                                        that come along the way. I wanted to experience the journey from an idea to the
                                        launch of a product on my own.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Full-Control:</strong> It goes hand in hand with having a tailored
                                        solution to my own needs and having independence rather than using a third-party
                                        platform. But it goes far beyond it. I wanted to make the decisions when it
                                        comes to supporting students that cannot afford to pay for the courses. I wanted
                                        to be able to apply discounts whenever I believed it would support people from
                                        developing countries. I wanted to support diversity in the developer community
                                        by enabling minorities to take the courses. By having a third-party course
                                        platform, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to apply those fine-grained rules, would I?
                                    </p>

                                    <p><strong>Open Sourcing:</strong> I keep the idea in my head to open source the
                                        whole thing eventually. It would be great to be able to strip out all the
                                        specific parts and only leave the generic parts of the course platform so that
                                        everybody could use it for their own educational domain to serve courses on
                                        their own hosted solution. It is still a long journey to make it happen, but you
                                        can support me if you like the idea.</p>

                            <p>In the following, I tried to break up the different areas of building an own course
                                platform. It will outline a few of the challenges I faced along the way, the decisions I
                                made and the things I have chosen to work with to realize the platform.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="course-platform-client">What to use for the client-side
                                application?</h2>
                            <p>Since the course platform is a web application, I wanted to use a single page application
                                (SPA) framework or view layer library for it. The bigger question was: Would I want to
                                learn a new framework/library or would I go with a known technology to build the
                                platform fast yet efficient? I think this particular decision has to be made for every
                                side project that evolves into a product eventually. I decided for the latter, using
                                React as my core library for the client-side application, and <a
                                    href="../essential-react-libraries-framework/index.html">complement it with further
                                    libraries</a>. Often, I have side projects that lead me nowhere but I have learned
                                something new. This time, I wanted to ship the course platform as soon as possible,
                                because my second course waited to be launched on it. In the end, it depends on your own
                                priorities of learning something new or ending up with a product eventually. It is hard
                                to achieve both with a limited amount of time. Nevertheless, even though I have chosen
                                React as my core library, I ended up with enough challenges on the way to learn new
                                things.</p>
                            <p>Maintaining an own website, where I write frequently about web development, is a valuable
                                asset in order to know about all the little things that come with having an own hosted
                                solution. It was important for me to make the course platform accessible to search
                                engines, because I knew how valuable it would be to be exposed to organic search
                                traffic. I am aware that web crawlers became more efficient in crawling SPA applications
                                over the last years, but still I wanted to be on the safe side. So I decided to give
                                server-side rendering with React a shot. I would have had the option to go with a custom
                                server-side rendering solution or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/">Next.js</a>. Either way, I would learn
                                something new, because I never did server-side rendering in React in a professional
                                project. I made the decision to try Next.js in order to launch the course platform as
                                soon as possible by having a supportive framework. If I have time in the future, I can
                                always decide to roll out my custom server-side rendering solution to avoid the vendor
                                lock-in. But I must admit that developing with Next.js was a pleasant experience. It
                                came with its own challenges such as integrating <a
                                    href="../nextjs-redux-saga/index.html">Redux and Redux Saga on the server-side</a>
                                or having the non existent window object when using external libraries that are not
                                supported in server-side rendered environments. But I managed to solve them.</p>

                            <p>Regarding the course platform itself, I had to figure out how to present the content. I
                                tried to keep it simple by having a &ldquo;Browse Courses&rdquo; page, giving an
                                overview of courses and packages, and a &ldquo;Course Detail&rdquo; page, giving more
                                information about the course content. I didn&rsquo;t do any user testing regarding what
                                content should belong on the overview or detail page. (If you have any recommendations
                                for improvements, I would appreciate it if you reached out to me :-)) In addition, I
                                integrated the whole authentication flow from sign up, sign in to sign out and password
                                reset and password change capabilities. If an user wants to enroll in a course, a
                                payment dialog would open up. Once a student is enrolled in a course, they will have a
                                dedicated page to access all the course content. The course content that is shown on the
                                overview and detail pages is only one large JavaScript blob. It was the easiest way in
                                the beginning without worrying about storing these meta information somewhere else.</p>

                            <p>In terms of styling, I kept it simple from the implementation perspective by using the
                                built-in style option provided by Next.js. Basically, it is CSS in JS with a pre-loaded
                                styling framework. In addition, I think I am doing fine to implement an own application,
                                but when it comes to styling I have to learn heaps from others. Before ending up with
                                various custom CSS definitions that are cluttered in the whole application, I tried to
                                abstract certain layouts from the beginning. That way, I ended up with a couple of
                                colored backgrounds with optional radiants, rotated backgrounds, and <a
                                    href="../react-svg-patterns/index.html">SVG background patterns</a>. All of them are
                                implemented in a reusable way. So I had to worry about them once, but wouldn&rsquo;t
                                need to touch them again afterward. They are only composable components which make use
                                of React&rsquo;s children for each content item.</p>

                                the job, so I decided in favor of Material UI even though I heard only good things about
                                Semantic UI in React. I wanted to give the latter a shot in the first place, but as it
                                was about time to choose one UI library to complement my React core, the Semantic UI
                                website was offline. I will try it the next time, because people highly recommend it.
                                After all, I think it doesn&rsquo;t make a huge difference which UI library you choose,
                                as long as it includes all the features you are about to use in your application.</p>

                                I had to make it responsive. Even though I try to avoid CSS as much as possible, I
                                figured that using a combination of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                                After all, it boils down in aligning your containers differently on mobile, desktop and

                                are hosted on Vimeo but only accessible on the platform&rsquo;s domain, source code
                                projects to showcase examples but also to get students started with boilerplate
                                projects, and further readings related to the topics.</p>
                            <p>It was a necessity to introduce the user domain to keep track of users and eventually
                                their enrolled courses as well. The course platform had to have an authentication
                                solution with sign up, sign in and sign out but also password change and password reset.
                                In an ideal world with unlimited time, the best solution would have been to roll out my
                                own solution yet without implementing the underlying authentication flow from scratch. I
                                would have used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="http://passportjs.org/">Passport.js</a> along with a Koa, Express or Hapi
                                server to manage the API requests. But I didn&rsquo;t for keeping the first iteration of
                                the course platform as minimal viable product (MVP). So I decided in favor of Firebase
                                to manage my users but also their enrolled courses. This decision might cause trouble
                                eventually when I have to migrate over to an own solution, but so far I am running on a
                                free plan which is sufficient.</p>
                            <p>The second course that I have launched along with the platform teaches state management
                                in React. Two of its three packages include exciting source code projects. A couple of
                                these projects are boilerplate projects to get students started with firebase
                                authentication in plain React but also when using it with other complementary libraries
                                such as MobX or Redux.</p>

                                It should be a standalone service, because so far I have used a couple of other server
                                applications that deal only with one subject successfully. One of these services that
                                handles the payment processing will be mentioned later on.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="course-platform-content">How to organize the course content?
                            </h2>
                            <p>Before buying a course, students can read up the course content on a course details page,
                                download a preview of the ebook, read up a several testimonials, and checkout the FAQ
                                section for further information. Each course comes with a variation of packages to
                                enrich the learning experience.</p>
                            <p>Since I love to write about educational content, an ebook is the essential part of my
                                courses. The recent course, Taming the State in React, has a 250-page ebook that takes
                                you on a journey to learn and master Redux and MobX in React. These learnings could be
                                applied in any other solution such as Angular or Vue too. Furthermore, I added more
                                content around the ebook to give students a course feeling rather than just reading a
                                book. In the end, it boils down that only reading a book isn&rsquo;t sufficient to learn
                                such a practical topic. That&rsquo;s why the ebook already comes with plenty of hands on
                                examples where students have to code themselves.</p>
                            <p>I find when people have the opportunity to use all their senses to learn something new,
                                like reading, listening and trying something on their own, they are much more likely to
                                learn from it. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to build an own course platform in the first
                                place, because it gave me the opportunity to adjust the course content around the
                                essential ebook as its core.</p>
                            <p>Each student can download the ebook in the three formats PDF, EPUB and MOBI. I created
                                the books on Leanpub and I am grateful for their service. If you are going for the plain
                                ebook and don&rsquo;t want any extra material, you can <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://leanpub.com/taming-the-state-in-react">buy
                                    it on their platform</a> too. On the course platform though, you would get a bunch
                                of more references to reading material when enrolling in the bare essentials.</p>
                            <p>After I finished writing the ebook, I had the idea to add screencasts to complement the
                                course. It would enrich the learning experience, because students could follow me on how
                                to build a couple of applications from scratch with all the reasoning behind it. So I
                                had to figure out how to give access to videos without streaming them myself on the
                                platform, yet without giving them out for free because I would have hosted them
                                somewhere else. I compared YouTube and Vimeo to solve the problem of video streaming. In
                                the end, I have found out that Vimeo, even though it would require me to subscribe for a
                                Plus Account, would give me domain level access controls to only allow streaming the
                                uploaded video material on my course platform’s domain. It wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to
                                access them on Vimeo. Youtube doesn’t offer such a feature (only on request for high-end
                                customers).</p>

                            <p>The last course of mine had three packages ranging from only buying the 250-page ebook,
                                that offers a practical learning experience, to having access to exciting source code
                                projects and screencast series. It is always hard to estimate what people would pay for
                                a course. Over the last 6 months I invested every free minute in the content, so I would
                                argue it has a great quality. After completing the course, students are set up to build
                                their own applicatiions using the taught topics in a practical environment. It goes
                                beyond the basics and teaches best practices in scaling applications. In the end,
                                students bought all kinds of packages evenly distributed. Hence, I would assume that the
                                pricing matched pretty well. Surprisingly though, the complete course package was sold
                                the most for $99.</p>

                            <p>On the administrative side of the platform, there isn&rsquo;t any automation involved
                                yet. Before launching the platform along with the course, I thought it would be a good
                                idea to setup a &ldquo;Contact &amp; Troubleshoot&rdquo; page. It includes common
                                questions that I would have expected after the launch and in addition included a
                                pre-filled subject and body when writing emails with all the information (e.g. email
                                address and user id on the platform) that I would need to resolve certain issues. It
                                involved topics such as upgrading a course package, enrolling in a course when the
                                course was bought somewhere else or requesting an invoice.</p>

                            <p>The most frightening part for me was the payment and checkout flow when launching the
                                course. That&rsquo;s why there are two shortcut contact emails to give notice about
                                payment issues. Fortunately, no one had to make use of these emails, because everything
                                went flawlessly. I tested the payment flow well before launching the platform (more
                                about this later), but you never know in what kind of problems your users might run. It
                                gets more of an important subject when money is involved. So it gave me a better feeling
                                to know that I would have the troubleshoot area when launching the platform and the
                                course.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, I built a simple admin page before launching the platform. The page gives me
                                access to all users on the platform (email, username, sign up date, enrolled courses and
                                revenue driven by user). Moreover, there are two actions to add courses manually and to
                                show enrolled courses (course id, package id, purchase date, revenue, currency, payment
                                type) per user. In addition, the admin dashboard has a couple of filter and sorting
                                features to make it easier to navigate through it. But everything is kept pretty simple
                                on that side, because only I would see it in the end. By having all this information, it
                                became simple to associate users and courses to entities in the database, to email
                                requests or to payments on the Stripe or PayPal dashboards.</p>

                            <p>Especially the ability to add courses manually to a user was important for me, because of
                                these following three things:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First, it was my backup in case of a successful payment that didn&rsquo;t lead to an
                                    enrollment in the course. Luckily it never happened.</li>
                                <li>Second, it would give me the opportunity to add courses to users who bought the
                                    course somewhere else. For instance, before launching the course, I had several
                                    people pre-ordering it on other platforms. That way, I could easily add them to
                                    their pre-ordered packages when they signed up on the platform.</li>
                                <li>Third, I can provide students who cannot afford to pay for the course an option to
                                    access the course without going through the payment flow. That way, I hope to
                                    support groups of minorities and people from developing countries. Last but not
                                    least, I can manually upgrade the packages of students. Partly, it helps me to
                                    enroll Patrons from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                        href="https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch">Patreon</a> to enroll them to course
                                    content over time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="course-platform-server-side">What about the server-side
                                application?</h2>
                            <p>So far, I only mentioned the client-side application without telling you anything about
                                the server-side application. That&rsquo;s because there is no real server-side
                                application. If I had decided to go with Passport.js instead of Firebase for my user
                                authentication process, I would have implemented it as an authentication server using
                                any library such as Express, Hapi or Koa. If that had been the case, I would have gone
                                with any database to store my users, courses and invoices, because the data structure
                                wouldn&rsquo;t become too complex. I also invested a bit of time to evaluate outsourcing
                                the data storing to a third-party provider such as MLabs or MongoDB Atlas. But in the
                                end, I went with Firebase on the client-side application. It helped me to keep the first
                                iteration of the course platform as MVP.</p>
                            <p>Firebase on its free plan only allows 100 simultaneous connections. I wasn&rsquo;t too
                                sure about this number. Having Google Analytics on my own website, it could be
                                considered as too low when announcing a new product. That&rsquo;s why I upgraded the
                                plan for the course launch in case there would be a spike of users on the platform.
                                After launching the course, I saw that 100 simultaneous connections would have been
                                sufficient. Even though the launch went with several launch stages, the number of
                                simultaneous users on my platform never went over 47 for the initial release and later
                                on never over 74. It went higher on my own website though, where I put the launch blog
                                post. So I think it depends on where you link your audience when launching a product on
                                your own platform.</p>

                            <p>I created two firebase projects for development and production environments. Under the
                                assumption that everything should work regardless of the environment, it gave me an
                                effortless experience to develop the platform itself. It enabled me to have my
                                development sandbox to make mistakes in the early stages.</p>
                            <p>So far, the only server-side application for my course platform is my payment server
                                powering Stripe for charging credit card payments. It is one of my few microservice to
                                keep concerns separated and I hope when adding new server-side functionalities that I
                                can keep them in similar small scale applications like the payment server. In the
                                following, you will read more about the challenges in a whole when dealing with customer
                                payments on your own platform.</p>
                            <p>Last but not least, I have a couple of APIs that power my course platform as well. As
                                already mentioned, the platform uses Firebase and Vimeo as external services, even
                                though I don&rsquo;t have to touch Vimeo&rsquo;s API. Vimeo only allows me to upload and
                                stream videos from their platform with restricting it to my platform domain. In
                                addition, Stripe and PayPal are used to process payments and there is a neat currency
                                API that allows me to have currency conversion in the payment flow.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="course-platform-payment">What about payment on a course
                                platform?</h2>
                            <p>Using an own payment solution was one goal of having an own course platform. It gives you
                                the promise of low fees when customers purchase a product, because you only have to pay
                                the payment gateway fee and the currency conversions. In addition, it is empowering to
                                be able to charge customers yourself without relying too much on third-parties. Hence
                                another goal was it to learn about the different payment options, how to integrate them
                                in an application and how to serve different needs (credit, PayPal, &hellip;) for your
                                customers.</p>
                            <p>There were 4 different payment options that I found out about:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Stripe</li>
                                <li>PayPal</li>
                                <li>Braintree</li>
                                <li>Gumroad</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Previously, I used Gumroad to sell pre-orders of my course. It is a great solution for
                                offering a product. The payment flow is fully handled by Gumroad and it doesn&rsquo;t
                                take any effort to embed their checkout form on your platform. It comes with a great
                                design as well. In the end, there was one missing feature. After purchasing a course, I
                                would have wanted a callback function that notifies the course platform about a
                                successful payment. Afterward, the course platform would enroll the student in a course.
                                But without having the callback function, there was no way to enroll a student. It would
                                only be possible to manually lookup the order on the Gumroad platform. It wouldn&rsquo;t
                                have been possible to provide the whole checkout experience on the course platform.
                                That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t use Gumroad for the course platform.</p>
                            <p>It was exciting for me to use Stripe for credit card purchase for an own professional
                                product. Considering the conversations about Stripe on Hacker News, Reddit and Podcasts,
                                it must be a great product. Because I was so excited about using Stripe, Brainstree was
                                never an option for me, even though it would integrate both credit card and PayPal
                                purchases. In the end, maybe Braintree would have been the better solution. Because
                                whereas Stripe was an effortless integration, integrating PayPal in the course platform
                                was a troublesome experience. After all, I decided in favor of Stripe and PayPal and
                                never gave Braintree a shot. Maybe the next time, because it is always exciting to learn
                                something new.</p>
                            <div class="read-before">

                            <p>Before deciding to integrate PayPal as well, I read up several resources to figure out
                                how much people would want to use PayPal over credit card. It wasn&rsquo;t possible to
                                come up with any statistical evidence, but people reported increased sales when offering
                                PayPal. Still, I had the notion to prefer credit card over PayPal for the course
                                platform and therefore discouraged users from using PayPal by having an extra step in
                                the checkout process. The extra step was introduced during the course launch. Before,
                                people used both payment options rather equally. But after introducing the extra step,
                                people started to use their credit card over PayPal. There is no strong evidence, but I
                                think the course purchases weren&rsquo;t going down due to discouraging from using
                                PayPal.</p>

                            <p>There was another crucial decision for the checkout experience. I decided to enforce a
                                sign up before a student could enroll in a course. If a user wanted to enroll in a
                                course, but didn’t have an account yet, he/she would be redirected to the sign-up page
                                in order to create an account or to sign in into an existing account. There was no way
                                to measure it, but it might be that there is a number of users who didn&rsquo;t enroll
                                in a course because of this restriction.</p>
                            <p>An alternative would have been to create a temporary account on the user&rsquo;s behalf
                                when enrolling in a course. But I figured that it could lead to a bunch of problems. For
                                instance, what happens if the student has an account already, but didn&rsquo;t sign in
                                before, and now needs to merge the course into his/her existing account? Another crucial
                                step would be to complete the account registration afterward. If users missed it, they
                                would wonder where they can access the course. In order to access the course material,
                                you need to have an account on the platform. After all, all these problems led me to
                                introduce the sign up redirection as simplest solution for it.</p>
                            <p>There are a couple of features in the checkout itself. For instance, users can purchase
                                more than one license. In the calculation of the course, users with multiple licenses
                                get a discount based on the licenses count. Another feature would be the ability to
                                support courses that are for free. Users can decide to support the free course by
                                donations. That way, a course can be kept for free to enable other students to enroll in
                                them without any costs.</p>

                            <p>It is not the best solution to charge in a foreign currency as a European citizen. As
                                most of my website readers come from the United States, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to
                                confront them with another currency. Still, I would want to avoid the currency exchange
                                fees if it is possible. They can get exceptional high especially when using PayPal.
                                Since a greater part of students is from Europe, it was a step in the right direction to
                                offer Euro as currency as well. In conclusion, users could choose from US Dollar and
                                Euro as currency for their purchase.</p>
                            <p>It wasn&rsquo;t too difficult to add the currency feature to the course platform. There
                                is a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://fixer.io/">neat
                                    API</a> to pull in all the latest currency exchange rates for a base currency. For
                                instance, calling <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://api.fixer.io/latest?base=USD"><a
                                        href="https://api.fixer.io/latest?base=USD">https://api.fixer.io/latest?base=USD</a></a>
                                would output all the exchange rates when USD is used as base currency.</p>

                            <p><strong>So what steps did I take to have a robust payment flow?</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unit and integration tests for the payment business logic</li>

                            <p><strong>And what steps did I take to have fallbacks in case of payment issues?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fallback email templates if a user ran into a payment issue on the

                                        <li>no one had to make use of it</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>Getting familiar with the Stripe and PayPal dashboards</li>
                                <li>Setting up an admin page to have an overview of users and courses<ul>
                                        <li>being able to associate accounts with courses, payments on the Stripe and
                                            PayPal dashboards, and emails</li>
                                        <li>being able to enroll users manually in case a payment was successful, but
                                            he/she didn&rsquo;t enroll in the course</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>That way, I was prepared in case of any payment issues. In the end, nothing bad happened
                                due to testing, type checking and manual testing. But I must admit that the payment flow
                                was the feature that was tested the most on the course platform.</p>

                            <p>You can choose whatever hosting platform suits you. The most efficient one for me was
                                using <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://m.do.co/c/fb27c90322f3">Digital Ocean</a>. It powers all of my

                                not the newest kid on the block, but I like its simplicity to get people without much
                                experience started in this domain. It is simple to implement things such as SSL or an
                                own database by using its plugin system. Dokku is great for running different kinds of
                                one application as well. For instance, the course platform has a staging and production
                                instance. So I am always able to test the production ready application when deploying it
                                to my staging instance.</p>

                                be a great product and I love its ability of having immutable deployments. Re-deploying
                                my applications on Dokku gives sometimes downtime with a 502 bad gateway. I would need
                                to figure out how to solve it. Initially, I thought it would be because of the droplet
                                size, but it wasn&rsquo;t and all of my other applications re-deploy instantly. So I
                                need to investigate why it happens. However, in the end the now service was a bit too
                                expensive when having an own domain and didn&rsquo;t fit into the rest of my hosting

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="course-platform-tracking">How to track user activity?</h2>
                            <p>Basically, I use 2 out of 3 services for tracking:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First, the course platform uses Google Analytics with the <a target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                        href="https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga">react-ga</a> node package. It is a
                                    simple drop in solution that makes it easy to track the most important user
                                    activities on your website. Since I use Google Analytics for all of my websites and
                                    applications, it makes it maintainable to manage those properties at one place.</li>
                                <li>Second, the course platform uses <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                        href="https://sentry.io">Sentry</a> for error tracking. It is only a small
                                    JavaScript ES6 service that forwards errors to the Sentry API with the help of the
                                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                        href="https://github.com/getsentry/raven-node">raven</a> and <a target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                        href="https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js">raven-js</a> node packages for the
                                    server-side and client-side. It is used for errors in React components and as a
                                    Redux middleware. Before, I wanted to use <a target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://trackjs.com/pricing/">Track.js</a>,
                                    because I knew it from my former job, but it turned out to be too expensive. Sentry
                                    has a free version.</li>
                                <li>The third service is not used yet, but I am planning to integrate it in the future.
                                    It is called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                        href="https://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> and would allow me to track
                                    fine-grained activity on the platform. For instance, it would be valuable to know
                                    how many times a preview of an ebook was downloaded or how often different formats
                                    (PDF, EPUB, MOBI) were consumed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In the end, Google Analytics and Sentry give me a bigger picture of user activities and
                                great error reporting for the course platform.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="course-platform-launch">How to launch a course platform?</h2>
                            <p>It was the most frightening thing to finally launch the course platform along with the
                                course. I worked on both for the last 6 months while having a 9 to 6 job and invested
                                every free minute, weekend and holiday in it. You can read more about the journey in my
                                <a href="../learn-react-redux-mobx-state-management/index.html">launch blog post</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>Before launching everything, it was great to know that the course platform already ran
                                for one month without any issues. Users were able to purchase my previous ebook, <a
                                    href="../the-road-to-learn-react/index.html">The Road to learn React</a>, on it. I
                                think it is a great assurance to test the platform under the radar before an official
                                launch.</p>
                            <p>As the day of the launch came into reach, I felt two increasing psychological effects:
                                impostor syndrome and procrastination. It was tough to finish the last 10% of the course
                                itself and the course platform. Regarding the impostor syndrome, I spoke to others
                                before the launch and they assured me that it was a normal feeling. Most of them knew
                                the feeling before launching something themselves. Especially, when it is about
                                educating others in a topic. However, it was exceptionally hard to endure and if I
                                hadn&rsquo;t promised the course in advance on social media and worked every free minute
                                on it over the last 6 months, I might have just not launched it. But I did and it was
                                great to see people actually enrolling in it and taking the course to learn about Redux
                                and MobX.</p>
                            <p>For the launch day, I have written up a launch blog post for my website and essentially
                                linked all the initial traffic to it. If people were interested in the course, the
                                article would point them to the course platform. Otherwise, my own website would be able
                                to handle most of the traffic in case of any surprising spike of user activities.
                                Furthermore, my interested people wouldn&rsquo;t end up from the beginning on a paywall,
                                but on a personal blog post that tells the story behind the product.</p>
                            <p>As mentioned, I upgraded the Firebase plan for the launch day and the following days to
                                handle more than 100 simultaneous users on the course platform. 24 hours before the
                                launch, in the middle of the night, I panicked because I didn&rsquo;t have any assurance
                                that the server wouldn&rsquo;t break in case of too many users hitting the platform. So
                                I ran a stress test on my course platform with the help of an external service in the
                                night before the launch. The stress test went flawlessly even though I wonder up to
                                today if it wasn&rsquo;t a fake after all. But it gave me a peaceful and restful night
                                though.</p>
                            <p>Being more and more involved in having an own website and platform to be managed, I read
                                up a couple of relevant marketing articles each second week. Fortunately, I have my
                                girlfriend Liesa on my side <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.iamliesa.com/">who is professionally active in the topics around
                                    content marketing</a>. So it was great to have her as my backup. However, even
                                though knowing about a couple of tricks in the domain, I have had a hard time to
                                transform them into action items. There is always this bad feeling when pitching someone
                                else an own product. Even more when money is involved. In a perfect world, I want to
                                give people a great experience without needing to pitch it to them. Nevertheless, if the
                                educational content that I produce is the way I want to go in the future, I guess I have
                                to learn how to cope with it.</p>
                            <p>There were two occasions when I had a bad feeling about pitching my own product: Product
                                Hunt and my mailing list.</p>
                            <p>As a regular Product Hunt user, I wanted to include the platform for my launch. I read a

                                launching on it. Two weeks before the launch, I approached two potential hunters on
                                Twitter. I procrastinated doing it in the first place, because I didn&rsquo;t want to
                                pitch my course at all. However, I hand picked those two hunters as the best fit for my
                                course. Unfortunately, yet expected, as it was a pretty late request and cold mailed, I
                                never got an answer from them. I think it is too bold after all to just reach out to
                                people with whom you never connected before. I haven&rsquo;t had a good feeling about it
                                from the beginning, but at least I tried. A couple of days before the launch, I decided
                                to hunt my own course as product and prepared all the material for it.</p>
                            <p>My mailing list had over 7000 subscribers at the time of the launch. Usually, I update my
                                subscribers every month about recent articles from my website about web development. So
                                I never spam them. I am so grateful for the people believing in my content and
                                subscribing to it. It was tough though to grow such a mailing list and it was a lot of
                                effort that I have put into it over the last 18 months. Since I hate subscribing to too
                                many newsletters myself, I try to keep the curated content update on a monthly base.
                                However, now it was time to make use of the mailing list, because I launched a course
                                that I worked on for over 6 months after all. So when I read about launches of other
                                products, it was hard to accept that people would email their subscribers up to five
                                times for a launch. Even though it grew the sales for them massively, I couldn&rsquo;t
                                do it for my own launch. In the end, I barely managed to write two launch emails. It is
                                because I don&rsquo;t want to bother people with something in the first place. I would
                                want to avoid all the sales stuff, if I could do it, but after all if you make a living
                                out of it you have to accept how the business world runs :-/</p>
                            <p>In the end, I found the open rate of 40% for both emails great though. Having no
                                comparison after all, I am grateful that people read those emails and clicked through
                                the content that was delivered to them. I never tried to add anything about SPF and DKIM
                                to prevent landing in spam folders of my subscribers. (Should I?) Perhaps it would be an
                                option to improve the delivery rate. You can view both launch emails in <a

                            <p>Finally, there was the launch day. The course was supposed to be officially launched on
                                Twitter. It would be morning for the US west coast. Since I am travelling through south
                                east asia at the moment, it was midnight for me. I was prepared for a long night in case
                                of spiking user activities, comments on Twitter or Product Hunt, or any issues with the
                                course platform itself. But there weren&rsquo;t any issues or bigger discussions in the
                                end. I got great feedback on Twitter from my followers and was retweeted by some great
                                people in the React community (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                            <p>On Product Hunt the votes didn&rsquo;t take off, but after a couple of minutes Dan
                                Abramov commented on my course. That was a huge surprise. I am not sure what would have
                                made me more happy at this point in time; spiking upvotes or the comment by Dan. I guess
                                in this moment, the latter outweighed everything else. It made me happy!</p>

                            <p>After tweeting about it, a couple of days later someone from Product Hunt approached me
                                and featured the course in the popular section. I didn&rsquo;t mention his name here
                                because I am not sure if his name should appear in this article. But thank you so much
                                again for reaching out and supporting me in this case! After all, even though there are
                                hundreds of articles out there how to launch on Product Hunt and how people did it, I
                                found for myself that the most important thing to do is to keep being yourself.</p>
                            <p>The courses didn&rsquo;t bring me any six figure revenue, but that&rsquo;s okay, because
                                I never expected too much from it. I hoped that it would compensate the work that I have
                                put into it over the last 6 months and it did that well. Regarding the course itself,
                                maybe it was too much niche or I am just too late with the topic itself, but I think
                                state management in any view layer library or single page application framework will not
                                go away in the near future. The course offers plenty of foundational and advanced
                                knowledge about the topic. So it is a great investment for everyone to learn about those
                                things when building web applications with advanced state management.</p>
                            <p>Were there any hiccups during the launch? I was prepared for emails and people asking
                                questions during the launch, but even though there were people buying the course,
                                everything went surprisingly well. For instance, because I was prepared, I could easily
                                add course packages to users that have bought the course somewhere else. That way, I was
                                also able to upgrade users from pre-orderings when they wanted to access the complete
                                course. The email templates prevented any bigger issues and kept the emails short yet
                                precise. For instance, there is no invoice system yet, but people could ask for it with
                                the contact form. Furthermore, there was no payment problem at all even though I would
                                have been prepared for the case.</p>
                            <p>In the end, I want to thank everyone who supported the launch of the course. Be it on <a

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="course-platform-costs">How much to pay for an own course
                                platform?</h2>
                            <p>The costs for an own course platform can be summarized into ongoing subscriptions and one
                                time payments. In the beginning, when I started to write the ebook, I made a one time
                                payment on Leanpub to create an ebook on their platform. It costs $99 at at time of
                                writing this article. Leanpub makes it effortless to self-publish an ebook and they
                                offer plenty of options to write it. In my case, I simply connected my GitHub repository
                                with the manuscript to my Leanpub account and the platform took over to generate an
                                ebook from the markdown. Afterward, you can decide on your own if you want to sell your
                                ebook on their platform or take it on another platform. I decided to make use of both.
                                As a cheaper alternative to Leanpub, you can convert several input formats into your own
                                ebook formats by using something like <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>.</p>
                            <p>There was no way around buying an own domain for the course platform. But that was only
                                $11.99 for a year, because it wasn&rsquo;t too fancy. In addition, as already mentioned
                                in the article, I host all of my websites, applications and APIs on <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://m.do.co/c/fb27c90322f3">Digital
                                    Ocean</a>. The dedicated droplet for the course platform costs $10 a month, even
                                though I am sure it would run with a $5 droplet as well.</p>
                            <p>The platform uses the free Firebase plan at the moment. Only for the launch I was
                                cautious and upgraded to the $25 plan to allow more than 100 simultaneous connections.
                                It was a one time investment.</p>
                            <p>Last but not least, the videos streamed on the course platform are powered by Vimeo Plus.
                                It offers domain access level controls when being on this plan and costs $5 per month.
                            </p>
                            <p>One time payments:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>99$ Leanpub</li>
                                <li>25$ Firebase</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Monthly Subscription:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>$1 Domain</li>
                                <li>$5 Vimeo Plus</li>
                                <li>$10 Digital Ocean</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>So effectively it costs me $16 per month to run the course platform now.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="course-platform-upcoming-features">Any planned features for
                                the course platform?</h2>
                            <p>There are so many ideas in my head to improve the course platform and to open source it
                                eventually, but it takes a lot of resources to realize all of these things. It took me
                                already 4 days to write up this article to get people excited about the project. Apart
                                from the course platform itself, the courses on the platform are in great shape. A
                                couple of days ago, I released the 4th edition for <a
                                    href="../the-road-to-learn-react/index.html">The Road to learn React</a> to keep it
                                up to date for students to learn React for free. Furthermore, people started to
                                translate it to Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Italian and Korean.</p>
                            <p>My long term objective would be to open source the platform eventually. I guess it could
                                be a valuable option for everyone to get an independent course platform up and running.
                                In addition, a framework for a course platform makes it always easier to just focus on
                                quality content itself. In the end, it is a challenge to strip out all the specific
                                parts to keep the course platform as a generic platform while having limited time.
                                Perhaps someone wants to fund the project to help me to keep going with it :-)</p>
                            <p>A couple of days ago, I launched another addition for the course platform: a partner
                                program. It should give people the opportunity to spread the word about a course on the
                                platform by earning a cut of the revenue that is made with their referrals. So far, it
                                works as simple as sharing a link to the platform with your own partner identifier. If a
                                person buys a course on the platform coming from the referral link, the partner gets 50%
                                of the revenue. There are so many people out there who recommend great courses and I
                                wanted to provide them an option to earn their share of money with it. If you have an
                                account on the platform, you can access the referral page in the navigation bar.</p>
                            <p>I would love to add <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity">Purchasing Power
                                    Parity</a> to the course platform to enable everyone around the world to afford
                                buying courses. So far, I haven&rsquo;t found out about a neat open source API that
                                would give me the discounts depending on country codes. Do you know about one or want to
                                build one as open source project? Nevertheless, at the moment it is a manual process to
                                provide discounts for students from other countries when they reach out to me. An
                                alternative way to enroll for a course on the platform would be <a target="_blank"

                                    as Patron</a> to unlock course content over time.</p>
                            <p>Update: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/rwieruch/purchasing-power-parity">I added Purchasing Power
                                    Parity to the course platform and open sourced a JavaScript library for it</a>.</p>
                            <p>At some point, there should be a flexible way of upgrading packages in a course. For now,
                                it is a manual process by using an email template as well. Students enroll in a second
                                package of the same course and can get a refund of the amount they have paid. In
                                addition, integrating coupons on the platform would allow me to give discounts for
                                people coming from my own website or somewhere else. I guess it is a neat way to give
                                price off for certain events or student groups.</p>
                            <p>On the course platform, it is possible to purchase team licenses as well. So far there
                                wasn&rsquo;t made any heavy usage of it, but it would be neat to have a proper team
                                dashboard to invite team members to an enrolled course with multiple licenses.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the technical perspective: What about Cloudfare? I only heard good things about
                                it regarding caching and content delivery around the world, but never had the time to
                                introduce it to the platform nor to any of my websites. It frightens me too much to
                                introduce another caching layer besides of webserver caching and service workers. If you
                                know more about it, I am looking forward to get some tips about it :-)</p>
                            <p>So far, there are more than 1100 users signed up on <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://roadtoreact.com/">Road to React</a>. It is
                                growing by more than 30 sign ups per day, but most of the people only sign up for the
                                free ebook coming from my own website. A couple of days ago, I have introduced the
                                ability to unsubscribe from an email subscription. I intend to send out emails in the
                                name of the platform to notify people about course launches and content updates, but
                                wanted to make sure that users are able to unsubscribe from it. It think that&rsquo;s
                                not unusual, is it? ;-) Far in the future, there are plans to automate it by using an
                                external service (what about <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a>?). I want to keep it cheap yet nicely
                                integrated with a high delivery rate.</p>
                            <p>In general, the platform should be more robust in the future. There should be more
                                snapshot tests for components, unit and integrations tests for business logic and more
                                type checking with Flow. So far, there isn&rsquo;t any CI connecting to my GitHub
                                repository, for instance for test coverage, but I intend to do it in the near future as
                                well.</p>
                            <p>In the end, everything boils down to prioritization. It is difficult to prioritize the
                                time on things that have the biggest impact to sustain my educational content because
                                most often it is for free. It is a tough job to keep the ball rolling for the course
                                platform, course content, free and up to date ebooks, <a target="_blank"
