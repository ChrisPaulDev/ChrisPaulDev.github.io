                            <p>Recently, I was wondering how I could escape the web development bubble for a while. 2017
                                was full of React, Redux and MobX in JavaScript where I have written actively about
                                those topics on my blog, developed small (<a
                                    href="https://github.com/rwieruch/favesound-redux">1</a>, <a
                                    href="../how-to-build-your-own-course-platform/index.html">2</a>, <a
                                    href="https://github.com/rwieruch/open-crowd-fund">3</a>, &hellip;) and <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.small-improvements.com/features/?ref=chrispaul.dev">large scale
                                    applications</a> based on them, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://leanpub.com/u/rwieruch">self-published two educational ebooks</a>, and
                                implemented a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://roadtoreact.com/">course platform</a> with those technologies to teach
                                others about them. The last year was all about those subjects, so I needed a side
                                project to escape it for a while and to get into a zen mode of learning again.</p>

                            <p><strong>How did I get to machine learning?</strong> A couple of months ago, I started to
                                listen to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="http://ocdevel.com/podcasts/machine-learning">Machine Learning Guide
                                    podcast</a>. I found out about it by chance and highly recommend it to get you an
                                introduction for machine learning. Tyler Renelle is doing an amazing job to get you
                                excited about the topic. I almost feel like I am following him on the same path to learn
                                about machine learning now. Even though I didn&rsquo;t actively plan about learning ML,
                                it was interesting to hear about all those foreign concepts. There it was again; this
                                excitement when everything is unexplored. I felt like a whole new world opened up in
                                front of me. It was the same feeling when <a
                                    href="../what-is-an-api-javascript/index.html">I finally got the foot into web
                                    development</a>.</p>

                            <p>As I read about a couple of machine learning articles, the course on <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=yL1MQRWYyXQ&amp;offerid=467035.1560515719&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fmachine-learning">Machine
                                    Learning by Andrew Ng</a> was the by far most recommended to get started in machine
                                learning. I have never taken an online course from start to end before, even though I
                                actively give these online courses myself, but I decided to give it a shot this time.
                                Fortunately, the course had started one week ago. So I enrolled in it and by now
                                finished it. It&rsquo;s a blast and I recommend everyone who wants to get into ML to
                                take it. Even though it&rsquo;s a big commitment in the first place to enroll in the
                                course for 12 weeks. But more about it later.</p>

                            <p>After university, I immediately took a job to work on a large scale application in
                                JavaScript. So I never had the chance to apply most of my technical and mathematical
                                learnings that I learned at university. Yet it was great to grow in web development and
                                JavaScript over the last years and I don&rsquo;t want to miss that time. But when I
                                started to learn about machine learning, it was a pleasure to cram out all the learnings
                                in math. Suddenly I had a use case where it would make sense to take the derivative of a
                                function: gradient descent. Why aren&rsquo;t schools and universities showing these real
                                world use cases in a simplified version to motivate their students with hands-on
                                problems? Learning all the theoretical things is fine, but when you finally apply the
                                derivative for an optimization problem, it actually becomes exciting. It was always
                                difficult for me to pick up a book about plain math. But as I started to relearn the
                                math for machine learning again, I had an applicable domain for it. So I started to
                                relearn all those things from university which obviously go beyond taking the
                                derivative.</p>

                            <p><strong>So why is this article about machine learning in JavaScript?</strong> If you are
                                coming from web development as I do, you might know how difficult it can be to make the
                                leap over to another domain such as machine learning. It comes with its own constraints.
                                Not only the whole domain with its algorithms is different, but also its programming
                                languages suited for machine learning paired with mathematical concepts from linear
                                algebra, calculus and statistics. Personally, I found it an interesting strategy to boil
                                down the different learning parts in machine learning: algorithms, programming languages
                                (e.g. Python) and mathematical concepts. When I looked at those, I knew that I would
                                definitely have to learn about the machine learning algorithms themselves and the
                                underlying mathematical concepts. But I could strip out the best suited machine learning
                                programming language and replace it with a language where I felt most efficient:
                                JavaScript.</p>

                            <p>The following article should give you a <strong>gentle introduction to machine learning
                                    from a web developer&rsquo;s perspective</strong>. It should show you the
                                opportunities in the field of machine learning and why it could be an advantage to learn
                                about those things with JavaScript as a web developer now. Furthermore, it should give
                                you guidance on how to approach the topic without learning everything from scratch. You
                                can leverage the implementation details in JavaScript and focus on the theoretical
                                parts: algorithms and mathematics. If you are familiar with the topic and have
                                improvements for the article, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to me. I am still
                                learning about the topic myself and I would be grateful for any nudges in the right
                                direction. After all, the guidance I give only describes my learning path, but I hope
                                that others can make use of it.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="machine-learning-javascript">Machine Learning in JavaScript?
                                What&#39;s wrong with you?</h2>

                            <p>By now I can hear the crowd yelling: JavaScript is not suited for machine learning. You
                                may be right. But there are a couple of things why JavaScript could actually make sense
                                to learn about machine learning as a web developer. And maybe not only as a web
                                developer. Personally I think it has huge potential. That&rsquo;s why I attempt to make
                                the topic more accessible for web developers.</p>

                            <p>As mentioned before, you might be already proficient in JavaScript. You don&rsquo;t have
                                to learn another programming language from scratch. You can apply the theoretical parts
                                of machine learning in any language. So why not JavaScript? Then you only have to learn
                                about the theoretical parts in ML by applying the implementation details in JavaScript
                                in the early stages. Afterward, you can always switch to another language for machine
                                learning. Nobody takes that away from you. But you decide how to break down the learning
                                paths for deploying your own learning curve and experience. You keep the overwhelming
                                amount of things to learn to a minimum and thus might be better off to stay in a <a

                                challenges ahead and your level of skill in balance.</p>

                            <p>JavaScript is evolving with a rapid speed. It is applied in several domains by now where
                                nobody would have seen it a couple of years ago. You can see it on <a target="_blank"

                                    href="https://nodejs.org/en/">backend applications</a>. It&rsquo;s not all about web
                                development anymore. So why not machine learning? Maybe it becomes computational and
                                implementation-wise efficient to write machine learning algorithms in JavaScript
                                eventually. Recently a couple of libraries emerged which give us a framework around
                                algorithms and neural networks. Those libraries make machine learning computational
                                efficient by using WebGL in the browser. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not the best idea to train
                                machine learning models in the browser, but using pre-trained models in the browser
                                might be a promising field in the future. Last but not least, maybe it is just used as
                                <strong>a bridge for web developer entering the field of machine learning</strong> but
                                using a better suited programming language afterward. Nobody knows, but I want you to
                                think about these possibilities.</p>

                            <p><strong>But what about the performance?</strong> Machine learning algorithms are highly
                                dependent on performance. Often they are using so called vectorized implementations to
                                stay computational efficient. Graphical computations performed by the GPU are similarly
                                used (see image; taken from webgltutorials.org). That&rsquo;s what makes C++ as a
                                programming language so interesting for machine learning. Therefore, one would assume
                                that JavaScript itself is not the best suited programming language. However, with <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a> becoming
                                popular for GPU accelerates executions in the browser, it is utilized for recent machine
                                learning libraries in JavaScript too.</p>

                            <p>Another concern exists regarding the training phase. Why should it happen in the browser
                                at all even though it is supported by the GPU? In highly efficient machine learning
                                architectures the computation is offloaded to distributed systems. But there again,
                                recent machine learning libraries for JavaScript are used with pre-trained models
                                (inference phase) and not the training phase in the browser. The model comes from a
                                server and is only used for further predictions and visualizations in the browser. So
                                why shouldn&rsquo;t it be possible to offer a framework around this interplay of
                                training phase backend and inference phase frontend? As mentioned before, using
                                pre-trained models in the browser could be a common practice in the future. People are
                                working eagerly on making those models smaller in size. So it&rsquo;s not as difficult
                                anymore as it was in the past to transfer them via a remote API.</p>

                            <p>One big argument against machine learning in JavaScript is its lack of libraries. But
                                that&rsquo;s not so true anymore. There are a bunch of libraries helping you out. For
                                instance, consider a couple of programming languages in machine learning and the areas
                                where they are primarily used:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Math / Data Analysis</strong>: Matlab, Octave, Julia, R</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Mining</strong>: Scala, Java (e.g. Hadoop, Spark, Deeplearning4j)</li>
                                <li><strong>Performance</strong>: C/C++ (e.g. GPU accelerated)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Next, you can see why Python makes so much sense in machine learning. It has a suitable
                                set of libraries for the different tasks assigned to the programming languages from
                                above and even more good fitting solutions:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Math</strong>: numpy</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Pandas</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Mining</strong>: PySpark</li>
                                <li><strong>Server</strong>: Flask, Django</li>
                                <li><strong>Performance</strong>:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>TensorFlow (because it is written with a Python API over a C/C++ engine)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Keras (sits on top of TensorFlow)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>So yeah, it seems like that it just makes sense to use Python for machine learning. But
                                the JavaScript ecosystem offers a rich set of libraries suited for most of the tasks
                                too. Because most of them are not only used in machine learning, the JavaScript
                                ecosystem developed a couple of sophisticated solutions beforehand:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Math</strong>: math.js</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: d3.js</li>
                                <li><strong>Server</strong>: node.js (express, koa, hapi)</li>
                                <li><strong>Performance</strong>:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Tensorflow.js (e.g. GPU accelerated via WebGL API in the browser)</li>
                                        <li>Keras.js</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Even though a library such as math.js is not running on the GPU for expensive
                                computations, I guess one could use utility libraries such as <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/gpujs/gpu.js">gpu.js</a> to
                                accelerate its performance. Furthermore, the recent high level machine learning
                                libraries such as Tensoflow.js come with their own set of mathematical functions which
                                are indeed accelerated by the GPU. In the future you would either use one of those
                                dedicated machine learning libraries for JavaScript which are GPU accelerated or math.js
                                gets its own GPU accelerated wrapper eventually.</p>

                            <p>Except for the last libraries (Tensorflow.js and Keras.js) on the previous list, none of
                                the other libraries is strictly related to machine learning. They were developed
                                independently and thus have a strong community on their own. So JavaScript isn&rsquo;t
                                so much behind other programming languages when it comes to the toolset. But for sure,
                                the sky is the limit. There are endless of improvements which could be made or libraries
                                which are needed. That&rsquo;s just another opportunity for open source developers to
                                implement the necessary tools around it. And I assume in the future, there will evolve
                                sophisticated libraries for machine learning in JavaScript. Just in the recent time,
                                there were a couple of interesting libraries released or announced for machine learning
                                in JavaScript.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p><a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow.js</a> (previously <a
                                            href="https://deeplearnjs.org">Deeplearn.js</a>): The library by Google is

                                        with Python. Afterward you can deploy them to the web by using TensorFire or
                                        Keras.js.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Only 2017 brought up those exciting and promising libraries. So I am curious what 2018
                                will offer us.</p>

                            <p>As you can see, so far the article pointed out a couple of concerns using JavaScript as
                                your programming language to get started in machine learning. However, most of these
                                reasons are not as much valid anymore as they were a couple of years ago. JavaScript is
                                evolving and thus its capabilities of applying machine learning with it. Even though it
                                may be only the bridge for you to learn about machine learning in the first place.
                                Afterward, learn a more suited programming language for it. But then you have only to
                                learn the programming language without worrying too much about the machine learning part
                                anymore. Even though learning machine learning is an ongoing process and you will always
                                learn something new in this fast paced domain. But it&rsquo;s exciting, because it has
                                so many facets.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="machine-learning-javascript">Machine Learning as an
                                Opportunity for Web Developer</h2>

                            <p>I made my own motivation clear in the beginning of this article. However, that&rsquo;s
                                not all to the story. There are plenty of reasons and opportunities to dive into machine
                                learning as a web developer.</p>

                            <p>First of all, it is always an opportunity to broaden ones horizon. It doesn&rsquo;t only
                                apply to machine learning. But whenever you feel you are getting too comfortable, take
                                it as opportunity to learn something new. You don&rsquo;t need to take the practical way
                                of implementing machine learning algorithms in JavaScript, maybe only learning about the
                                math and the algorithms on a theoretical level suffices for you. After all, you keep
                                your mind sharp by learning.</p>

                            <p>Second, there are plenty of job opportunities out there in the domain of machine
                                learning. Sure, it is a overly hyped topic in the recent years, but not without any
                                reason. Students and researcher in the field are hired straight away from university.
                                There seems to be a huge demand in the general fields of AI, data analysis and machine
                                learning. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.switchup.org/research/best-data-science-bootcamps">Bootcamps are
                                    popping up or shift their focus to data science</a>. JavaScript can be the entry

                                beyond web development and maybe to a wider range of job opportunities. Perhaps the
                                market in web development paired with machine learning grows in the next years. But even
                                if it doesn&rsquo;t, you can learn a programming language suited for machine learning to
                                apply all your theoretical learnings in it. After all, <a target="_blank"

                                    there comes the time when web developers have to make an important decision</a> to
                                get into a different domain than web development. Maybe their own works becomes
                                redundant due to machine learning. So why not learning ML?</p>

                            </div>


                            <p>Third, even though JavaScript facilitates a lot of utility libraries for machine
                                learning, there is plenty of space for improvements in the domain. Just thinking briefly
                                about it, I am able to come up with a few things. For instance, speaking about
                                computational efficiency, most of the libraries are not GPU accelerated yet. They would
                                benefit a lot from these to be computational efficient for machine learning in the
                                browser. In terms of visualizations, there are a couple of charting libraries, such as
                                d3.js as low level visualization library, but there aren&rsquo;t any suitable
                                abstractions for those visualizations applicable for machine learning related problems.
                                It should be simpler to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/svmjs/demo/">plot the result of a
                                    support vector machine</a> or to visualize a performing neural network explicitly

                                    href="https://github.com/javascript-machine-learning/mnist-neural-network-deeplearnjs">not
                                    implicitly based on the used domain problem</a>. There is enough space for open
                                source combining machine learning and JavaScript. You could contribute to widen the
                                bridge for web developers entering the field of machine learning.</p>

                            <p>Last but not least, there is great effort involved on the side of ML open source
                                contributors (e.g. Tensorflow.js, TensorFire, Keras.js, Brain.js) to enable machine
                                learning in the browser. However, most often the documentation is suited for machine
                                learners entering the browser domain and not the other way around as I described it in
                                this article. Thus these solutions come with a lot of fundamental machine learning
                                knowledge which isn&rsquo;t taught along the way. In return, it makes it difficult for
                                web developers to enter the machine learning domain. Thus there is a great opportunity
                                to pave the way for web developers into the domain of machine learning by making those
                                fundamental topics and ported libraries accessible in an educational way. That&rsquo;s
                                the point where I try to tie in my knowledge in teaching about those things. In the
                                future, I want to give you the guidance if you are keen to enter the field of machine
                                learning as web developer. Read more about this in the final paragraphs of this article.

                                field of machine learning as a beginner can be a buzzword heavy experience. Where should
                                you start? There is so much terminology to clarify in the beginning. Is it <strong>AI or
                                    machine learning</strong>? What&rsquo;s all the hype about <strong>deep
                                    learning</strong>? And how fits <strong>data science</strong> in this area?</p>

                            <p>Let&rsquo;s start our journey with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AI (artificial
                                    intelligence)</a>. <em>&ldquo;It is the intelligence of a machine that could
                                    successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can.&rdquo;</em> There
                                is a great analogy in the <em>Machine Learning Guide</em> podcast to convey the
                                information of AI: Whereas the goal of the industrial revolution was the simulation of
                                the physical body through machines, it is the goal of AI to simulate the brain for
                                mental tasks through algorithms. So how does machine learning relate to AI? Let&rsquo;s
                                have a look at the a couple of subfields of AI:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>searching and planning (e.g. playing a game with possible actions)</li>
                                <li>reasoning and knowledge representation (structuring knowledge to come to
                                    conclusions)</li>
                                <li>perception (vision, touch, hearing)</li>
                                <li>ability to move and manipulate objects (goes into robotics)</li>
                                <li>natural language processing (NLP)</li>
                                <li>learning</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The last one represents machine learning. As you can see, it is only a subfield of AI.
                                However, it might be the only essential core fragment of AI because it reaches into the
                                other subfields of AI too. It reaches into them even more over the recent time. For
                                instance, vision as subfield becomes more of a part of <a target="_blank"

                                    learning</a>. Where other techniques, e.g. domain specific algorithms, dominated the
                                domain in the past, machine learning enters the field now. Now deep neural networks are
                                often used for the domain. So what are applicable domains of AI and therefore most often
                                machine learning? A bunch of domains and examples:</p>

                            </ul>

                            <p>So machine learning is a subfield of AI. Let&rsquo;s dive into the subject itself. There
                                are a couple of great definitions for machine learning, yet when I started out with the
                                subject, I found the one by Arthur Samuel (1959) most memorable: <em>&ldquo;The field of
                                    study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
                                    programmed.&rdquo;</em> How does it work? Basically machine learning can be grouped
                                into three categories: <strong>supervised learning, unsupervised learning and
                                    reinforcement learning</strong>. It&rsquo;s quite an evolution from the former to
                                the latter. Whereas the former is more concrete, the latter becomes more abstract (yet
                                exciting and unexplored). The former, supervised learning, gives the best entry point to
                                machine learning and is used therefore in several educational machine learning courses
                                to get you into the field. In supervised learning, an algorithm is trained to recognize
                                a pattern in a given data set. The data set is split up into input (x) and output (y).
                                The algorithm is trained to map input to output by learning with the given data set
                                (<strong>training phase</strong>) the underlying pattern. Afterward, when the algorithm
                                is trained, it can be used to make predictions for future input data points to come up
                                with output data points (<strong>inference phase</strong>). During the training phase, a
                                <strong>cost function</strong> estimates the performance of the current algorithm and
                                adjusts the parameters of the algorithm based on those outcomes (penalization). The
                                algorithm itself can be simplified into a simple function to map an input x to an output
                                y. It&rsquo;s called <strong>hypothesis</strong> or <strong>model</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Predicting housing prices in Portland is one popular machine learning problem for
                                supervised learning. Given a data set of houses whereas each house has a size in square
                                meter (x), the price (y) of the house should be predicted. Thus the data set consists a
                                list of sizes and prices for houses. It is called a <strong>training set</strong>. Each
                                row in the training set represents a house. The input x, in this case the size of the
                                house, is called a <strong>feature</strong> of the house. Since there is only one
                                feature for the houses in the training set, it is called a <strong>univariate</strong>
                                training set. If there are more features for a house, such as number of bedrooms and
                                size, it becomes a <strong>multivariate</strong> training set. Increasing the size of
                                the training size (m) and the size of features (n) can lead to an improved prediction of
                                y whereas y is called a <strong>label</strong>, <strong>target</strong> or simply the
                                output. In a nutshell: A model is trained with a penalizing cost function to predict
                                labels from data points and their features.</p>

                            <p>Tom Mitchell (1998): <em>&ldquo;A computer program is said to learn from experience E
                                    with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance
                                    at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p>The previous use case of predicting housing prices in Portland is called a
                                <strong>regression problem</strong>. A <strong>linear regression</strong>, as explained
                                before, can be used to train the hypothesis to output <strong>continuous values</strong>
                                (e.g. housing prices). Another problem in the area of supervised learning to be solved
                                is called <strong>classification problem</strong> where a <strong>logistic
                                    regression</strong> is used to output <strong>categorical values</strong>. For
                                instance, imagine you have a training set of T-Shirts. The features, such as width and
                                height, can be used to make predictions for the categorical sizes X, M and L.</p>

                            <p>The previous paragraphs were a first glimpse on supervised learning in machine learning.
                                How does unsupervised learning work? Basically there is a given training set with
                                features but no labels y. The algorithm is trained without any given output data in the
                                training set. In a classification problem the algorithm has to figure out on its own to
                                classify the data points into clusters.</p>

                            <p>And last but not least, what about reinforcement learning? In reinforcement learning the
                                algorithm is trained without any given data. It learns from experience by repeating a
                                learning process. For instance, take this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning">flappy bird</a> which learns to
                                win the game by using neural networks in reinforcement learning. The algorithm is
                                learning by trial and error. The underlying mechanism is a combination of rewards and
                                penalizations to train the bird to fly. Similar as a real bird would learn how to fly.

                            <p>Last but not least, there might be another question popping up in your head:
                                <strong>What&rsquo;s the relationship of data science to machine learning?</strong> Data
                                science is often associated with machine learning. So one could argue that machine
                                learning bleeds into both domains: data science and artificial intelligence. However,
                                data science has its own subfields such as data mining and data analysis. It can often
                                be used coupled to machine learning, because data mining enables an algorithm to learn
                                from mined data and data analysis enables researchers to study the outcomes of
                                algorithms.</p>

                            <p>That was a broad introduction to the field of machine learning. If you are interested in
                                those topics related to JavaScript, keep an eye on my website over the next months. I
                                hope to cover a few topics to give people guidance entering the field as web developers.
                                As I said, I am learning about the topic myself and try to internalize these learnings
                                by writing them down.</p>

                            <p>There are a bunch of resources that I want to recommend for web developers entering the
                                field of machine learning. As for myself, I wanted to stimulate my senses for at least
                                12 weeks. That&rsquo;s how long it is said to complete Andrew Ng&rsquo;s machine
                                learning course. Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s my personal roadmap and it might not be
                                suited for everyone. But it helped me a lot following a strict routine and having enough
                                learning material along the way. So it might help other web developers too.</p>

                            <p>If you just want to get a feeling for the topic, start to listen to the <a

                                episode 11. Tyler Renelle has done an amazing job giving an introduction to the topic.
                                Since it is a podcast, just give it a shot while you exercise in a gym. That&rsquo;s how
                                I entered the field of ML.</p>

                                    Learning course</a> by Andrew Ng which takes 12 weeks for completion. It takes you
                                on a long journey from shallow machine learning algorithms to neural networks, from
                                regression problems to clustering problems and from theoretical knowledge in the field
                                to applied implementations in Octave or Matlab. It is intense and challenging, but you
                                can do it by dedicating a couple of hours each week to the course and the exercises.</p>

                            <p>The machine learning course goes from linear regression to neural networks in 5 weeks. In
                                the end of week 5, I was left with an overwhelming feeling. It was a combination of
                                &ldquo;Can week 6 become even more complex?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wow, this course taught me
                                all the building blocks to implement a neural network from scratch&rdquo;. Andrew gives
                                a perfect walkthrough to learn about all these concepts which build up on one another.
                                After all, machine learning has a lot in common with the composition of functions from
                                functional programming. But you will learn about this yourself. I can only say that it
                                was an overwhelming feeling to see an own implementation of a neural network performing
                                in the browser for the first time.</p>

                            <p>Along the way, I did all the weekly assignments and solved them in Octave. In addition, I
                                implemented most of the algorithms in JavaScript as well as as exercise for myself and
                                as estimation how feasible it is to implement these algorithms in a different language
                                not suited for machine learning but suited for web developers. It worked and I published
                                all of them in a open <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/javascript-machine-learning">GitHub organization</a>.

                                story. I wrote about a couple of topic as well to internalize my own learnings, to get
                                guidance from others, but also to help web developers entering the field. So if you are
                                doing the course, check out the JavaScript implementations and walkthroughs along the
                                way. These walkthroughs are dedicated machine learning tutorials for Node.js and the
                                browser.</p>

                            <p>It&rsquo;s not comprehensive yet, for instance a neural network implementation with
                                vanilla JavaScript is missing, but I hope to complete all the bare bones algorithms in
                                JavaScript at some point. The neural network implementation is done with a recently
                                released library called deeplearn.js by Google which got rebranded to Tensorflow.js. I
                                was pretty excited to use it for the first time, and it was my personal reward, after
                                doing the course for 5 weeks, to use a library instead of implementing neural networks
                                in JavaScript from scratch. Have a look at the <a target="_blank"

                                see it as opportunity as well to contribute to the GitHub organization. Next on the
                                agenda are K-Means, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and principal component analysis (PCA)
                                from scratch in JavaScript!</p>

                            <p>After you have completed week 5 of the machine learning course, you should have a good
                                feeling about what&rsquo;s machine learning and how to solve problems with it.
                                Afterward, the course continues with shallow algorithms for supervised learning and
                                unsupervised learning. It gives elaborated guidance of how to improve your implemented
                                machine learning algorithms and how to scale them for large data sets. When you have
                                completed week 5, you should continue as well with the Machine Learning Guide podcast to
                                learn more about shallow algorithms and neural networks. I listened to it until episode
                                17, because afterward it goes heavily into natural language processing.</p>

                            <p>In addition, over the course of those weeks, I read <a target="_blank"

                                perspectives and stakeholders, and its history. After that, I started to read the open
                                source ebook <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning</a> (by Ian Goodfellow and
                                Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville). It happened after week 5 of the course and fitted
                                perfectly to all the foundational knowledge I learned so far. Even though I found it
                                quite a challenging book so far, I can recommend both books to give you even more
                                guidance along the way. Once I finish the second book, I want to read the free ebooks <a

                            <p>What else is out there to learn machine learning? Now after I completed the course by
                                Andrew Ng, I will take some rest to internalize all those learnings. Likely I will write
                                more about them for my blog. You can subscribe to the Newsletter if you are interested
                                in hearing about them. However, there a bunch of other courses out there which I want to
                                check out.</p>

                                However, if you are using high level libraries such as Keras.js or Tensorflow.js, you
                                will have the most important mathematical methods integrated by using their NDArrays,
                                Tensors and mathematical operations. Otherwise, there are a couple of other libraries,
                                not mentioning the mentioned again, which I didn&rsquo;t try yet. Keep in mind that not
                                all of them are GPU accelerated, but I guess when it comes to computational efficiency,
                                a couple of them will offer it in the future.</p>

                            <p>Another library didn&rsquo;t make it in the list, because it is is not actively
                                maintained: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs">ConvNetJS</a>. In addition, there are
                                two more libraries implementing shallow machine learning algorithms in JavaScript: <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/junku901/machine_learning">machine_learning</a> and <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/mljs/ml">ml</a>.
                                In those libraries you can find logistic regression, k-means clustering, decisions
                                trees, k-nearest neighbours, principal component analysis and naive bayes for
                                JavaScript.</p>

                            <p>Many of those libraries are only for machine learning in Node.js. Thus they are not using
                                the computational efficient WebGL in the browser.</p>

                            <p>If you have any other recommendations, please leave a comment below. If you know whether
                                certain libraries are active or not maintained anymore, please reach out as well. I
                                would love to keep this article updated for the future.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="machine-learning-programming-languages">More Programming
                                Languages for Machine Learning</h2>

                            <p>After learning and applying all the theoretical concepts in a programming languages of
                                your choice (e.g. JavaScript), you can always come back to learn a programming languages
                                best suited for machine learning. It can be a great learning experience in itself to
                                experience how much more efficient something can be implemented in a different language.
                                I had the same feeling when solving mathematical equations in Octave when doing them in
                                JavaScript before.</p>

                            <p>A previous paragraph has shown a couple of machine learning languages (Python, C/C++, R,
                                Scala, Java, Matlab, Octave, Julia) and their fields of expertise. The one outlier
                                facilitating everything with its libraries seems to be Python. I cannot give any
                                profound recommendation here, because I didn&rsquo;t use any of those languages in
                                relation to machine learning, but personally I would choose Python if I would continue
                                to learn about the topic after applying it in JavaScript. The one most recommended
                                resource regarding learning Python was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>. Andrew Ng
                                mentions in his machine learning course that often machine learning algorithms are
                                developed as prototype in Octave or Matlab but implemented in Python afterward.
                                Therefore I am still figuring out a pragmatic learning roadmap as a combination of
                                video, text and audio material for Python as I did for machine learning itself. If you
                                have any recommendations, please leave a comment below.</p>

                            <hr class="section-divider">

                            <p>In the end, I am curious about your feedback regarding machine learning in JavaScript for
                                web developers. As said, I am learning on a daily basis about the topic myself at the
                                moment. Most likely I will invest more time in this field in 2018, but I would love to
                                hear your thoughts about it too. Are you staying with me on this journey?</p>

                            <p>Furthermore, I am curious if you have any opportunities for me to get more into machine
                                learning in a professional way. At the moment, I am actively freelancing and consulting
                                in JavaScript and web development and building my own projects on the side, but I would
                                love to <strong>take the leap into machine learning for a professional
                                    position</strong>. I am eager to learn and would look up to mentors who are keen to
                                teach someone new to the field of machine learning. So please take a moment to think
                                about it and reach out to me in case there is anything where you can help me out :)</p>

                            <p>Last but not least, I want to announce <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://bri.im">BRIIM as a movement for machine learning in JavaScript</a>. I
                                hope I don&rsquo;t go out on a limb with it, but I am looking forward seeing JavaScript
                                becoming more accessible for machine learning in the next years. That&rsquo;s why I
                                started the BRIIM movement as a place for everyone to come together. <strong>It&rsquo;s
                                    an opportunity to act in concert as a community and not as individuals.</strong>
                                Instead of library communities being isolated from each other, it should give an entry
                                point for machine learning in JavaScript to work under a collective movement. Instead of
                                finding articles about machine learning all over the web, it would be great to have one
                                well maintained resource for it. Instead of scraping together all the pieces to learn
                                about machine learning in JavaScript, there should be one high qualitative resource to
                                pave the way for beginners. It&rsquo;s a movement to contribute together towards
                                widening the bridge for JavaScript enthusiast entering the field of machine learning. So
                                I hope to see you on the other side to join me on this journey.</p>
