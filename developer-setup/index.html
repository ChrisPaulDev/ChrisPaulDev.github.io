                            <p>This concise cheatsheet will give you an overview on how to setup your development
                                environment as a web developer. It was created for MacOS developers. However, you can
                                substitute the instructions and tools for Windows and Linux as well. So don&rsquo;t give
                                up yet if you are not a MacOS user. After all, setting up your development environment
                                all by yourself is your first challenge as a striving web developer these days. So
                                let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

                            <p>The following short checklist reflects my own development environment as being a
                                developer who operates on MacOS. There are different philosophies to shape your
                                development setup. Whereas there are people who prefer to have everything in one <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>,
                                there are also people who use several lightweight tools (e.g. editor, command line) but
                                combine them for their purposes. Personally, I follow the latter philosophy.
                                That&rsquo;s why you will find a bunch of lightweight tools in the following list.
                                However, if you want to have a more thorough guide on how to setup your machine with a
                                sophisticated IDE, head over to these guides. They are dedicated for a React setup, but
                                you can simply leave out React.js from the equation and you have an up and running IDE
                                after following one of these guides. Still, the list below might offer you a couple of
                                useful tools to complement your IDE as well.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="../react-js-windows-setup/index.html">React setup guide for Windows
                                        users</a></li>
                                <li><a href="../react-js-macos-setup/index.html">React setup guide for MacOS users</a>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>What if you are not sure which philosophy to follow? If you are just beginning with web
                                development, I encourage you to start out with an IDE which would mean you should follow
                                one of the guides from above. There you get everything out of the box and don&rsquo;t
                                need to worry about the tooling around your code. Once you become an intermediate
                                developer, checkout the more lightweight approach below.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>

                            <p>If you are a MacOS user, you should use Homebrew to install every other tool on your
                                machine with it. Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS. Rather than having to download
                                every application from a website, Homebrew allows you to install and manage applications
                                from the command line. It&rsquo;s great tool to get used to the command line in the
                                first place. You should feel comfortable on the command line as developer thus it makes
                                sense to perform as much tasks as possible there. In addition, Homebrew gives you the
                                ability to manage all of your applications with only one tool. You can get all the
                                necessary instructions for Homebrew <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="http://brew.sh/">on their website</a>. Otherwise, simply type the following
                                command in your command line (terminal) to install Homebrew.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #ef6155">/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>Afterward, Homebrew should be installed for you. It should be available on the command
                                line when you type <code>brew</code>. Whenever you install another tool with Homebrew,
                                type <code>brew update</code> in your command line to update the Homebrew repository
                                with all the recent versions of the packages. Afterward, you can install the desired
                                tool with <code>brew install &lt;tool&gt;</code> or upgrade it with
                                <code>brew upgrade &lt;tool&gt;</code>.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="git">Git and GitHub</h2>

                            <p>Git will be your distributed version control system. It manages your local projects on
                                your machine and your remote projects on platforms such as GitHub and GitLab. Sooner or
                                later, you will need it to collaborate on projects with other people, to manage your own
                                projects and to showcase your projects to the public as portfolio for hiring purposes.
                                Git should have been installed along the way with the Homebew installation. Type
                                <code>git --version</code> to verify that it is there. Otherwise, you can use Homebrew
                                for the first time to install it with the following command on the command line:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">brew</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">install</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">git</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>Now you can setup a GitHub account to manage your projects (repositories) on <a

                                will be your place to share, collaborate on and discuss about exciting projects.
                                Therefore, follow the setup instructions from the <a

                                In addition, you may want to setup a SSH connection to GitHub. It allows you to connect
                                to your remote repositories in a secure way. Therefore, follow the <a target="_blank"

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="sublime">Sublime as Editor</h2>

                            <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> is my editor of choice when I get
                                into coding. That&rsquo;s the part where it becomes opinionated. You can use any editor
                                or IDE of your choice. It&rsquo;s up to you. Other popular code editors are Visual
                                Studio Code, Atom and VIM.</p>

                            <p>Unfortunately, Sublime isn&rsquo;t directly accessible via Homebrew. But we can use <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://caskroom.github.io/">Cask</a> to install it. Cask is a another package
                                manager within Homebrew for GUI tools. For instance, Chrome could be installed on your
                                machine with Cask as well. Since I mentioned Chrome here, I recommend you using Chrome
                                for your web development purposes. It comes with powerful development tools. Otherwise,
                                you can use Firefox as viable alternative as well. But enough talking here, let&rsquo;s
                                install Cask and Sublime by using Homebrew.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">brew</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">install</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">caskroom</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">cask</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">brew</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">-</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">cask</span>

                            </div>


                            <p>Again, you can verify on the command line whether the installation for Sublime was
                                successful:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">sublime</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">--</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">version</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>Another little trick can be used to make sublime open the current directory from the
                                command line. In your command line type:</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">link</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">:</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">ln</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">-</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">s</span> <span style="color: #48b685">&quot;/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl&quot;</span> <span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">usr</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">local</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">bin</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">sublime</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>Now you should be able to open any directory from the command line with
                                <code>sublime .</code> Sublime comes with powerful settings and amazing customizations.
                                You can choose from a wide range of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="iterm">iTerm2 (Optional)</h2>

                            <p>MacOS and other OS&rsquo;s already come with their own command line (terminal) tools.
                                Thus, another command line tool is optional, but you might want to install one anyway
                                because of various benefits. Other command line tools often come with lots of advanced
                                features and thus they will enrich your daily toolset. I suggest <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> whereas Homebrew
                                with Cask helps you to install it.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">brew</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">cask</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">install</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">iterm2</span>

                            </div>


                            <p>After a successful installation, you can open iTerm2 instead of the default terminal on
                                your machine. You could install further stuff for iTerm2 like the <a target="_blank"

                                well. As mentioned, it comes with powerful integrations, beautiful themes and other
                                useful utility tools. Since this article is only a checklist, you have to dive deeper
                                into iTerm2 on your own.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="node-npm">Node and NPM</h2>

                            <p>If you are developing with JavaScript, there is no way around <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node and npm</a>. You can
                                find the installation instructions on the official website. Installing node will install
                                npm (node package manager) as well. The node package manager is used to install
                                libraries/frameworks (node packages) on the command line to your project.</p>

                            <p>There exists an alternative to install and manage node: <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a>. You
                                should be able to install it via Homebrew as well. In addition, there exists a <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows">Windows version for nvm</a> too. I
                                highly recommend to use nvm, because you can install and manage multiple node versions
                                with it. Furthermore, it helps you to install your node version as well.</p>

                            <hr class="section-divider">

                            <p>That are all the things you need for a development environment. Homebrew is used to
                                install all the tools for you on the command line. Cask is used on top of Homebrew to
                                install GUI applications such as Chrome, iTerm2 and Sublime. Then there is the editor
                                and the command line which should be selected carefully, because you will spend most of
                                your time as being a developer with them. If you are a JavaScript developer, there is no
                                way around node and npm and thus you should install them with nvm to manage multiple
                                node versions. Last but not least, git and GitHub should be used to manage your
                                projects. If you are just starting out with web development, you should build a
                                presentable portfolio on GitHub to showcase it. I am curious what you are going to code
                                as your first projects. You can share them on GitHub with me or in the comments of this
                                article.</p>
