                            <p>Hi, it&rsquo;s Chris. I am a german software engineer from Berlin but working remotely
                                most of the time. First of all, thank you for reading my blog. It&rsquo;s such a
                                pleasure to have you here! Just to make sure: I am the guy on the right-hand side of the
                                picture :)</p>
                            <p>A couple of words about my professional life: I graduated from university with a Master
                                of Science in Computer Science in 2014. At university <a
                                    href="../what-is-an-api-javascript/index.html">I discovered how empowering it can be
                                    to build applications</a> and thus built several applications in different
                                programming languages, domains and platforms. Straight out of university, I worked in a
                                full-time position as software engineer on a <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.small-improvements.com/?ref=chrispaul.dev">large scale web
                                    application using JavaScript and Java</a> to help thousands of customers to
                                introduce a feedback culture in their companies. Those years gave me a lot of practical
                                experiences in the field and I tried to convey a part of the information on my blog.
                                During this journey, I found out about teaching as a fulfilling activity and therefore
                                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://leanpub.com/u/rwieruch">self-published 2 ebooks</a> and <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://roadtoreact.com/">launched a
                                    course platform</a>. Fast forward in 2017, I decided to be self-employed, doing
                                freelance and consultant work mostly related to web development. But I am always keen to
                                learn something new, so I try to push myself every day. One of my recent learnings, by
                                doing courses, reading books, listening to audio material and <a
                                    href="../machine-learning-javascript-web-developers/index.html">applying those
                                    learnings in JavaScript</a>, is machine learning. I am open for any opportunities in
                                this field or software engineering, <a href="../work-with-me/index.html">so find out how
                                    to work with me</a>.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="values">Values and Mission</h2>
                            <p>I try my best to have a positive impact on the world. 99% of my code is open source for
                                everyone on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/ChrisPaulDev">GitHub</a>. Every time I build a product/service
                                for myself, I immediately think about how to open source it for others. Even though I
                                open source my work and offer lots of learning material for free, not everyone is able
                                to make use of it. Many people have no access to it because they didn&rsquo;t had the
                                chance to learn the English language in the first place. That&rsquo;s why I try here and
                                there to volunteer or to <a href="../giving-back-by-learning-react/index.html">donate
                                    money to good causes</a>. I have the strong believe that the major issue of
                                diversity in our industry is due to inaccessible education for people outside of the
                                western world. Apart from the language barrier, most educational content is too
                                expensive. Whereas a programming course for $99 might be affordable in the US,
                                it&rsquo;s out of reach for any eager programmer in South East Asia. I know that many
                                programmers producing educational courses need to make a living, I am sitting in one
                                boat with them, but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/ChrisPaulDev/purchasing-power-parity">there are options to make
                                    educational content affordable for others around the world</a> too. After all, I
                                hope that I can give something back by believing in these values and my mission to make
                                education more accessible to everyone.</p>

                            <p>Even though I do a lot of programming in my professional and spare time, there are other
                                things I treasure too. I am an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"

                                but I’m always struggling to memorize my learnings. I guess, that&rsquo;s why I started
                                to write down my notes of books I enjoyed to read. But it&rsquo;s difficult to keep up
                                with all the books. Nowadays I often encourage people to read more, because it&rsquo;s
                                such a fulfilling and meaningful activity. Some of my favorite pieces:</p>

                            <p>In another life, I wanted to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://soundcloud.com/schlenkermitturnbeutel">do music</a>. But I avoided the
                                stage at nightclubs when I got the first requests in my inbox. I preferred the anonymous
                                internet over any stage. That&rsquo;s why I never revealed my identity back in the days
                                and maybe that&rsquo;s why I never tried public speaking for conferences. Eventually, I
                                decided to code and started to enjoy it too. Still, music is one reason why I am staying
                                partly in Berlin. Nowhere else, I believe, will you find such a great selection of
                                electronic music.</p>
                            <p>The most important part in my life is my girlfriend Liesa. Without her I wouldn&rsquo;t
                                be able to sustain my every day doings. My life would be too chaotic. Every other week
                                she is not at home, my working schedule shifts dramatically. She keeps my life in
                                balance and is helpful in every part of it. You could argue that because of her I manage
                                to stay sane. Alongside, she encourages me for workouts, eating healthy food and is
                                always helpful when it comes to marketing for my professional stuff. Feel free to reach
                                out to her for various topics around <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.iamliesa.com/">content marketing</a>. She already works with a
                                couple of great companies.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="support-me">You like my content? Here are a couple of ways to
                                support it.</h2>
                            <p>I invest a lot of my free time into this website. Several hours a working week and most
                                of my weekend time. That way, I hope that I can help others to learn the things that I
                                have learned by myself. But I cannot deny that it costs a lot of time and energy to keep
                                the website up and running. As a return of investment, I get revenue from selling my
                                courses on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://roadtoreact.com/">Road to React</a> and a little affiliate marketing,
                                but that&rsquo;s nothing compared to the time and energy I put into it. Sometimes I
                                wonder how much easier it would be to quit, but then my readers encourage me to keep
                                going. I think it applies to everything in life: people have a big impact on this when
                                they cheer you up.</p>
                            <p>If you appreciate what I am doing, there are several ways to support me. It keeps the
                                educational content of mine up and running. Furthermore, it may help me to dedicate more
                                time to teaching students. I already made the leap to being self-employed, but most of
                                my time still goes into working with companies on their problems. If you like the
                                content on my website and other projects I create, you can consider one of the following
                                ways to support me with my adventure.</p>
                            <h3 id="be-my-patron">Be my Patron</h3>
                            <p>First, I run a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch">Patreon</a> account where you can back me
                                up. Your monthly pledge would help me to sustain my work in educating people. Most of
                                the time, I do it for free by writing educational articles, open sourcing libraries or
                                educational projects. Patreon is the perfect fit for people like me.</p>
                            
                            <h3 id="leave-a-review">Leave a Review</h3>
                            <p>Third, since I am writing educational books, my content began to end up on platforms such
                                as Goodreads and Amazon. If you liked it, it would mean a lot to me if you would invest
                                a couple of minutes to leave a rating or review. You can find my books on <a

                                <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://amzn.to/2QY2ONp">Amazon</a>. It&rsquo;s one of my pillars to sustain
                                my adventure to give out lots of content for free.</p>
                            <h3 id="share">Share</h3>
                            <p>Fourth, I am grateful for every share on social media of my articles. When you read
                                something on my website and find it valuable, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to share it. I
                                am always eager to keep the quality of my articles on a high level and I always try my
                                best to keep the content up to date. But it&rsquo;s not only for me: There might be a
                                follower of yours who finds it interesting too.</p>
                            <h3 id="learn-react">Learn React</h3>
                            <p>Fifth, it encourages me when people learn React through my articles, <a
                                    href="../the-road-to-learn-react/index.html">eBooks</a> or <a
                                    href="https://roadtoreact.com/">courses</a>. It keeps me motivated to improve the
                                material all the time. Even though the eBook is pay what you want, you can support me by
                                paying for it. It helps me to take more time to update, improve and extend the material.
                                A lot of people learned with my articles, books and courses and I encourage you to give
                                it a shot as well. If you liked it, spread the word to your friends who want to learn it
                                as well.</p>
                            <h3 id="contribute">Contribute</h3>
                            <p>Sixth, you can have a direct impact yourself. Every of my articles has a link to the <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://github.com/ChrisPaulDev/blog_chriswieruch_content">GitHub repository</a>
                                where I manage all of my content. You can open Issues or Pull Requests to improve the
                                articles. It is not easy to keep everything up to date being all by myself.
                                Additionally, it is not easy as a non native speaker.</p>
                            <p>In addition, you can write a guest blog post. Do you have an own website? Do you write
                                quality content? Do you want to get more readers to your website? My website generates
                                lots of traffic. You can help a lot of people in your topic of choice by teaching them.
                                A guest blog post that links to your website is a great contribution. It has to relate
                                to my content though.</p>
                            <h3 id="donate">Donate</h3>
                            <p>Last but not least, you can donate to support me. It is not time consuming, it is simple,
                                and it is a one time <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.paypal.me/rwieruch">donation</a>. After all, it helps me to take
                                time off to improve articles, to keep them up to date and to write more teaching
                                material.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="use">Things I Use</h2>
                            <p>The following is a selection of my tools that I use for my professional work. The links
                                to the resources can be affiliate links or referral links. The former give me some
                                provision, the latter provides you and me with a discount to a service or product. So
                                most of the time it&rsquo;s a win-win situation and these affiliate links are one way to
                                support me being self-employed. However, most importantly I hope that these resources
                                help you to build your business.</p>
                            <h3 id="digital-ocean">Digital Ocean</h3>
                            <p>When I revamped my website, I decided to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://m.do.co/c/fb27c90322f3">Digital Ocean</a> to host it. I don&rsquo;t
                                regret it and can highly recommend it. It powers all my websites, APIs and applications
                                by using only 3 Droplets (each $5 month). I believe one droplet would be sufficient, but
                                I like to separate them by domain. These are the benefits I see in using Digital Ocean:

                            <p>Every developer needs an IDE or editor/terminal combination. I like to have multiple
                                tools, by having each tool for a specific purpose, but combining them to one great
                                developer experience. That&rsquo;s why I am using Sublime Text and iTerm. If you want to
                                know how to set it up, you can find more about it over here: <a

                                for my needs to setup a Newsletter for my website. It has everything I need even though
                                I relied heavily on MailChimp before. Revue has the following great features:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>permalinks to newsletters</li>
                                <li>powerful integrations for fetching content automatically</li>

                            <p>Leanpub has helped me to self-publish <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://leanpub.com/the-road-to-learn-react">my first ebook</a>. They follow a
                                great philosophy: You don&rsquo;t need to release a finished book, because you can get
                                feedback from your readers along the way. Try it and be a self publisher.</p>

                            <p>Next to Leanpub, I used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.educative.io/collection/5740745361195008/5676830073815040">educative.io</a>
                                to release a course. The platform is pretty new on the market. The creators of educative
                                are helpful, supportive and very kind. I enjoyed the collaboration with them. The
                                platform itself offers all the tools you need to setup your course.</p>
