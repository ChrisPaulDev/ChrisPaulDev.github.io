                            <p>As a software engineer you will come to a point where writing matters. Perhaps you want
                                to leave your fellow developers a note, you have to write an e-mail to a customer or you
                                have to sum up the recent meeting notes. In my case, it went even further because I have
                                my own website where I write about software development and <a
                                    href="../the-road-to-learn-react/index.html">where I started to write my first
                                    ebook</a>. It was about time for me to dive into the topic of writing.</p>

                            <p>The article is a summary of my lessons learned from <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://amzn.to/2AsoDzh">On Writing Well</a>
                                by William Zinsser. I am no expert in this field, even less as a non native speaker, but
                                by providing a summary I hope to help other developers to improve their writing skills.
                                Apart from that it helps me to memorize my lessons learned.</p>

                            <p>I am eager to improve my language and writing skills. <em>On Writing Well</em> had topics
                                which are easier applicable than other topics for non native speakers. For instance, it
                                is easier to leave out all the clutter and keep the sentences and words simple. As a non
                                native speaker you are less intended to write in complex sentences with difficult words.
                                However <em>On Writing Well</em> had topics that were more difficult to apply. The
                                english language has a rich set of words and synonyms that are not always known for non
                                native speakers. Especially this fact makes it hard for non native speaker to fine tune
                                their writing in its meaning. But let&rsquo;s dive into my lessons learned.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="howToLearn">How to learn?</h2>

                            <p>Repetition is the key for learning. You have to repeat. It applies for every subject you
                                want to learn. You have to repeat and do it over and over again. &ldquo;You learn to
                                write by writing&rdquo; says William Zinsser. When you produce a certain amount of words
                                on a regular basis, you will improve eventually. But in order to learn writing well, you
                                cannot solely use your first draft of writing. You have to refine your writing and
                                rewrite it a dozen times. &ldquo;The essence of writing is rewriting&rdquo;.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="howToWrite">How to write?</h2>

                            <p>Imagine you start to write about a topic. Start to think small. &ldquo;Decide on the
                                corner of the subject you want to bite off. Cover that corner well, be satisfied by that
                                and stop.&rdquo; Make it a complete experience for your reader. Don&rsquo;t nibble on
                                another corner of the subject and leave the reader with an incomplete reading
                                experience.</p>

                            <p>When you write, &ldquo;go with your interest&rdquo;. Only then the reader can get your
                                enthusiasm and will enjoy it. Make it <strong>personal</strong>, <strong>simple</strong>
                                and <strong>clear</strong>. However, challenge your readers, don&rsquo;t be too
                                predictable when you write and let your readers think for themselves.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="aTransaction">A Transaction</h2>

                            <p>Always remember that writing and reading is a transaction between two people - an author
                                and a reader. The topic is not the only thing that drives a reader, it is the human
                                being behind that topic. It is the author who shows enthusiasm in his or her subject.
                                Make the written word your own - make it personal - only then the reader will go with
                                you.</p>

                            <p>Don&rsquo;t use difficult words to sound important. Only use them when they have purpose.
                                Otherwise take words that are as simple as possible to make your writing as clear as
                                possible. Use short words over long words. Same rules apply for sentences. Keep them
                                short. Use punctuation properly to make sentences simple and cut a long sentence in two
                                short sentences. &ldquo;The short sentence predominates&rdquo;. Cut every word that
                                doesn&rsquo;t have a purpose in the sentences. Cut every adverb whose meaning is already
                                in the verb. You have to &ldquo;strip every sentence to its cleanest components&rdquo;
                                says William Zinsser.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="makeItClear">Make it clear</h2>

                            <p>Build up your sentences in a logical order. Think in building blocks, like in a project,
                                where each block follows another building block. Don&rsquo;t write by accident. Every
                                clear sentence has been rewritten a few times until it transported the clearest meaning.
                                You have to avoid leaving your readers in confusion. Otherwise they have to re-read the
                                last paragraph and will eventually leave you for an author who transports the message in
                                a simpler way.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="removeClutter">How to remove the clutter?</h2>

                            <p>How to remove all the clutter regarding the last two lessons learned? Clutter is the
                                &ldquo;disease of writing&rdquo;. It is unnecessary words that don&rsquo;t add meaning
                                but complex sentence constructions. It is meaningless slang and duplicated sentences
                                that convey the same meaning. You have to remove everything without purpose. Be grateful
                                for everything you can throw away.</p>

                            <p>Especially as a technical writer avoid the growing arsenal of jargon in your field of
                                expertise. Try to transport the meaning of your written word so that everyone can
                                understand it. Imagine an audience of one and the one person is your spouse. Don&rsquo;t
                                let your reader translate each sentence, write as simple as possible.</p>

                            <p>The quickest fix according to William Zinsser is to strike things. Ask yourself if you
                                need the paragraph, sentence or adverb. Then keep it or strike it.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="makeItPersonal">Make it Personal</h2>

                            <p>Once you removed the clutter and made your text simple and clear, there might be no
                                personal style left. But there is always a human being behind the text. Be yourself, be
                                warm and be natural. If you can, write in the first person. Use <em>I</em>, <em>me</em>,
                                <em>we</em> and <em>us</em>. Avoid to use <em>one</em>, because the reader wants to
                                experience the transaction between a reader and writer. He or she wants to know you.
                                Stand out as a real human. Never lack the human ingredient.</p>

                            <p>If you can&rsquo;t write in the first person, at least think as if you would write from
                                your point of view. You can write your first draft in the first person. Afterwards you
                                cut out all the <em>I</em> and <em>me</em>. Still it will keep your implicit personal
                                style.</p>

                            <p>Believe in your opinion. Sell yourself. When your subject is your expertise, the subject
                                will sell itself. Avoid timidities (quite, a bit, &hellip;) in your writing. Mean it, be
                                confident with it or strike it. Be bold.</p>

                            <p>Believe in your identity and keep your integrity. Don&rsquo;t fool your readers.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="knowYourLanguageI">Know your Language (I)</h2>

                            <p>The english language is rich of words. Find your personal words you want to use in your
                                writing. Be certain about the words you use. Keep a dictionary to find their historical
                                roots, meaning and synonyms. Use words with care and originality. Read books from people
                                from whom you enjoy the writing. Have them as your role models.</p>

                            <p>The spoken word is looser than the written word. You should use common words over slang.
                                Make clear what you mean. Don&rsquo;t &ldquo;request someones input.&rdquo; Instead
                                &ldquo;request someones thoughts on your idea&rdquo;.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="unity">Unity</h2>

                            <p>Stick to <em>one set of variables</em>. William Zinsser calls it the <em>unity</em>.
                                Stick to one style and tone. Stick to one perspective. Do you write in the first or
                                third person? Use a consistent tense. Don&rsquo;t switch from past tense to present
                                tense and back again. Write formal or casual. Believe in your mood.</p>

                            <p>Don&rsquo;t change the set of variables in between of your writing. &ldquo;If you do, the
                                writing will control you and not the other way around&rdquo;. When you change variables,
                                adjust the writing from before. However, don&rsquo;t overplan. You should experiment
                                where your writing guides you. If it feels right, stick to it and adjust the variables
                                from before. But in the end have one unity of variables.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="theLead">The Lead</h2>

                            <p>The most important sentence is your first sentence. The second most important sentence is
                                the second sentence. Each sentence builds up on the other. Imagine it as an upside down
                                pyramid whereas each sentence broadens the pyramid. The pyramid gives room for more
                                detail. It gives room for the complexity of your topic.</p>

                            <p>Make sure that your readers know early what&rsquo;s in for them. State your motivation
                                behind the article and why your reader should read it. To make it more compelling make
                                it narrative and tell a story.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="theEnd">The End</h2>

                            <p>The last paragraph of your writing should be short. Only take a few sentences to wrap it
                                up. &ldquo;Look for the nearest exit&rdquo; says William Zinsser. You made your points
                                and have to stop when all facts are presented. Optionally you can come back to an open
                                question from your lead and answer it. It closes the cycle in your article or book.</p>

                            <p>In your research always collect more material than you will use. Research your material
                                everywhere and don&rsquo;t use the obvious resources. Take interviews, articles and real
                                world experiences into account. At some point stop to gather material. Make a clear cut
                                and start writing.</p>

                                    <p>Verbs - Use strong and precise active verbs over weak passive verbs. Your verbs
                                        are the most important elements in your sentence. &ldquo;They push the sentence

                                        Don&rsquo;t write about &ldquo;the green grass&rdquo;. Write about

                                        effect. Most of the time that effect should be achieved by your writing alone.

                                    <p>Dashes - Use dashes for two use cases: Use one dash to jusitfy the main sentence.
                                        Use two dashes in between of a sentence to add an enhancing detail.</p>

                            <p>Mood changers are words like <em>but</em>, <em>yet</em>, <em>however</em>,
                                <em>nevertheless</em> and <em>still</em>. Add them at the beginning of your sentence. As
                                early as possible make your reader clear that something has changed. If you use too
                                often <em>but</em>, you can substitute it with <em>however</em>. Use mood changers like
                                <em>meanwhile</em> and <em>today</em> to make your reader aware of the time.</p>

                            <p>In order to keep your writing visual you have to keep your paragraphs short. Reading is
                                visual. A reader will scan your writing and a reader will have it easier to follow you
                                in short paragraphs. Make your writing look inviting.</p>

                            <p>Always listen to what you write. You can choose your words based on their sound. William
                                Zinsser compared the words <em>serene</em> and <em>tranquil</em> whereas the one is soft
                                and the other one is irregular because of its unusual characters. Depending on your
                                context choose one of them.</p>

                            <p>Use the same voice in each of your writings. It comes back to the term <em>unity</em>.
                                Don&rsquo;t adjust your voice to fit the subject. Find your simple voice and make the
                                writing effortless for your reader. Don&rsquo;t add clutter like slang and nounism to
                                the path of reading.</p>

                            <p>The last paragraph form the last chapter, &ldquo;Write as Well as You Can&rdquo;, is
                                still stuck in my head. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily apply only to writing, but to all
                                our doings:</p>

                            <p><em>A reporter once asked him [a baseball player] how he managed to play so well so
                                    consistently, and he said &ldquo;I always thought that there was at least one person
                                    in the stands who had never seen me play, and I didn&rsquo;t want to let him
                                    down.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p>I can recommend to read the book <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="http://amzn.to/2AsoDzh">On Writing Well by William Zinsser</a>. It taught me a
