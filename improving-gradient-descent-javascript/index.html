                            <p>A recent article gave an introduction to the field of machine learning in JavaScript by
                                <a href="../linear-regression-gradient-descent-javascript/index.html">predicting housing
                                    prices with gradient descent</a> in a univariate regression problem. There are
                                several improvements to optimize the gradient descent algorithm that should be collected
                                in this article.</p>
                            <p>In general, when dealing with a regression problem, the outcome can already be influenced
                                by <a href="../polynomial-regression-model-selection-javascript/index.html">selecting a
                                    fitting model type</a>. It is not often the case that data points correlate linear
                                to each other. Hence the correlation is often curvilinear and thus it could be a
                                polynomial regression instead of a linear regression. But that isn&rsquo;t specific to
                                gradient descent. So let&rsquo;s dive into the properties to improve gradient descent.

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="learning-rate-gradient-descent-javascript">Learning Rate in
                                Gradient Descent</h2>
                            <p>The gradient descent algorithm converges with a multitude of iterations to a local
                                minimum (which could be the global minimum as well). The learning rate alpha determines
                                how fast the gradient descent algorithm converges. But you cannot simply choose a high
                                learning rate.</p>
                            <p>The learning rate alpha is crucial for gradient descent to succeed. If the learning rate
                                alpha is chosen too low, it takes ages until the algorithm will converge to a minimum.
                                It takes mini steps downhill to find the valley rather than taking a risk to accelerate
                                the algorithm. However, if the learning rate alpha is chosen too high, it be possible
                                that gradient descent never reaches the minimum, because it surpasses it by taking too
                                big steps. It can happen that one step already ends up on the next hill and missed the
                                valley in between. So how to choose the correct learning rate?</p>
                            <p>Fortunately you have the cost function. The returned cost of the function should be
                                minimized by every step the gradient descent algorithm takes towards a minimum. Thus you
                                can observe the cost while gradient descent is performed. The cost should decrease. If
                                they increase, your learning rate is too high and you need to decrease it. You can start
                                out with different learning rates (0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.03, 0.003, 0.0003, &hellip;)
                                in the beginning and adjust them over time depending on your performance of the cost
                                function.</p>

                                    implementations</a> and tweak their learning rates to get a feeling for them. It is
                                often a fine balance between a too high and too low learning rate.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="gradient-descent-converge-javascript">When does gradient
                                descent converge?</h2>
                            <p>Gradient descent converges eventually when selecting an appropriate learning rate. But
                                when should you decide to stop it, because the algorithm is trained to make predictions?
                                Basically there are two ways to stop it.</p>
                            <p>The obvious one is to stop it after a certain number of iterations (e.g. 1500). However,
                                this way you never know if gradient descent converged to a minimum. You could have
                                messed up the learning rate in the first place and thus your cost function
                                wouldn&rsquo;t have minimized the returned cost even though the algorithm ran with a
                                high number of iterations. You would have to observe the returned cost manually when
                                running the algorithm.</p>
                            <p>There is a more sophisticated way: Stop it when the cost decreases by less than a given
                                amount (threshold) for one iteration. That&rsquo;s the point where the cost reached a
                                certain minimum and thus the gradient descent algorithm is trained. If the learning rate
                                is messed up in the first place, the algorithm might never stop, because the threshold
                                doesn&rsquo;t go below the defined amount. Then there could be an escape condition to
                                stop the algorithm after a certain very high number of iterations. Afterward, the
                                algorithm should tell that it didn&rsquo;t converge but only ran all iterations and you
                                should start over with a different learning rate.</p>
                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="initial-parameters-gradient-descent-javascript">Choosing
                                Initial Parameters in Gradient Descent</h2>
                            <p>The parameters in a hypothesis function are trained by using gradient descent. For
                                instance, a hypothesis function for a simple univariate linear regression is defined as
                                <code>h(x) =&gt; thetaZero + thetaOne * x</code>. The input value x (e.g. size of house)
                                stays fixed the same as the output value y (e.g. price of a house) in a prediction
                                (hypothesis). But the parameters theta are trained over the course of the training
                                algorithm.</p>
                            <p>When starting out with gradient descent, you have to choose the theta parameters
                                randomly. Most often, these parameters start out with the value 0. As you know, a
                                gradient descent algorithm converges eventually towards a minimum. But the minimum
                                doesn&rsquo;t have to be a global minimum. In a multivariate regression problem it can
                                be a local minimum, because there are multiple local minima and only one global minimum.
                                Depending on the initial parameters for theta, you may end up in different local minima
                                but never in the global minimum. Thus you have to try different initial parameters for
                                theta in order to find out about different local minima and perhaps the global minimum.
                                Thus another optimization for gradient descent is choosing different initial parameters
                                for theta to start out at different locations in the hilly landscape to find out about
                                different valleys.</p>

                            <p>In a multivariate training set, not all features share the same range. For instance,
                                number of bedrooms of a house may range from 1 to 10 whereas the size of a house goes up
                                to the thousands. Therefore, it becomes difficult for the gradient descent algorithm to
                                adjust the parameters for the hypothesis function when there is such a gap between the
                                features. The algorithm is way more efficient when the features roughly share the same
                                range. It is because because the parameters will adjust quickly on small ranges and
                                slowly on large ranges. When the variables of the features are uneven, it becomes an
                                inefficient task to descend towards the minimum.</p>
                            <p>The optional range is between -1 and 1 for each variable of a feature. But it isn&rsquo;t
                                a strict requirement, since it should only help to improve gradient descent. There are

                            <p>For instance, in a <strong>mean normalization</strong> the feature scaling can be
                                performed with <code>xScaled = (x - mean(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))</code>. So if x
                                represents number of bedrooms with a range of 3 to 5 and a mean value of 4, then
                                <code>x = (bedrooms - 4) / 2</code>.</p>

                            <p>A first naive implementation of gradient descent often involves programmatic loops. The
                                algorithm needs to run through a lot of iterations to learn (which it still needs to
                                after the vectorization), but also through all the data (m times) in the training set.
                                In a multivariate linear regression, the algorithm has to run through all the features
                                as well (n times). It becomes an inefficient computation and tedious task to implement
