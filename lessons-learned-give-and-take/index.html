                            <p>Recently I have read <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="http://amzn.to/2olhgRv">Give and Take: A revolutionary approach to Success</a>
                                by Adam Grant. It is an inspiring book and I found myself taking too many notes while
                                reading it. Now I want to summarize my learnings, to internalize them, but also to give
                                others access to it.</p>

                            <p>In his book, Adam Grant dives deep into the spectrum of altruistic to selfish
                                personalities. Anyone, who reads the book, might be able to identify his or her own
                                personal traits. It can differ in your personal and professional lives. Moreover, as
                                Adam Grant shows, you can apply the principles of giving and taking even in companies or
                                communities. The book shows and encourages the benefits of giving instead of taking.
                                Furthermore it dives into the role of a giving personality and shows ways to avoid being
                                exploited.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in
                                the darkness of destructive selfishness&rdquo; - Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

                            <p>You cannot apply it like a cookbook. Nobody wants to encourage a faking personality. But
                                it certainly will help you to understand the principles of giving and taking
                                personalities. Perhaps the book is a good incentive to change your behavior to the
                                better.</p>

                            <p>The book had a lasting impact on me. <a
                                    href="../giving-back-by-learning-react/index.html">I read it while I travelled Laos,
                                    got to know different volunteering projects and decided to donate money to it</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>In addition, I was able to see the intersection of the topic to give and take and open
                                source in software development. Contributing in open source can be a draining
                                volunteering task. The book shows ways to prevent the burnout of giving that shows up
                                too often for open source contributors.</p>

                            <p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the learnings. Keep in mind that these notes are only a summary of
                                my learnings from the book. They stand on the shoulders of interviewees, researchers,
                                and obviously Adam Grant.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="giversAndTakers">Givers and Takers</h2>

                            <p>Adam Grant distinguishes the behavior of people into reciprocity styles. Two of them are
                                givers and takers. The third one will be described as matcher later on. In addition,
                                there are fine grained variations in each style.</p>

                            <p>Takers: &ldquo;Takers have a distinctive signature: they like to get more than they give.
                                They tilt reciprocity in their own favor, putting their own interest ahead other&rsquo;s
                                needs. Takers believe that the world is a competing, dog-eat-dog place. They feel that
                                to succeed, they need to be better than others. To prove their competence, they
                                self-promote and make sure they get plenty of credit for their efforts.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a taker, you help others strategically, when the benefits to you
                                outweigh the personal costs.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;[Takers] feel entitled to pursue self-serving goals and claim as much value as
                                they can.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Givers: &ldquo;[A giver is the] opposite of a taker [&hellip;]. In the workplace, givers
                                are a relatively rare breed. They tilt reciprocity in the other direction, offering to
                                give more than they get. Whereas takers tend to be self-focused, evaluating what other
                                people can offer them, givers are other-focused, paying more attention to what other
                                people need from them.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;If you are a giver, you might use a different cost-benefit analysis: you help
                                whenever the benefits to others exceed the personal costs.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a giver at work, you simply strive to be generous in sharing your
                                time, energy, knowledge, skills, ideas, and connections with other people who can
                                benefit from them.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;[Givers] might not think about the personal costs at all, helping others without
                                expecting anything in return.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="chamleon">On Being a Chameleon</h2>

                            <p>Being a giver is quite common outside of the workplace. We act like givers in close
                                relationships to our family and friendships. In the workplace, the principle of giving
                                and taking gets more complicated. There a third reciprocity style emerges: the matchers.
                            </p>

                            <p>Matchers: &ldquo;[Matchers are] striving to preserve an equal balance of giving and
                                getting. Matchers operate on the principle of fairness: when they help others, they
                                protect themselves by seeking reciprocity.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>None of these reciprocity styles is fixed for yourself. When evaluating yourself, you
                                will find yourself traveling across these styles. You will become a giver when
                                interacting with your close friends yet become a matcher or taker in the workplace.</p>

                            <p>In the workplace itself, people find themselves traveling between these styles again. You
                                might be a giver when mentoring others but be a taker when negotiating your salary. Yet
                                you become a matcher when sharing experiences with a coworker.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Every time we interact with another person at work, we have a choice to make: do
                                we try to make claim as much value as we can, or contribute value without worrying about
                                what we receive in return?&rdquo;</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="successLadder">Givers and Takers on the Success Ladder</h2>

                            <p>&ldquo;[It&rsquo;s] critical but often neglected: success depends heavily on how we
                                approach our interactions with other people.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Research shows that givers are at the bottom of the success ladder. You might would
                                expect that matchers or takers are at the top of the success ladder. Neither is true,
                                because it is the giver again who is on the top.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;The worst performers and the best performers are givers: takers and matchers are
                                more likely to land in the middle.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>After all, there is a higher likelihood that givers end up at the top of the success
                                ladder. One lesson by Adam Grant will show you how to become a champ and not a chump
                                when interacting with takers and matchers.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="theLongRun">The Long Run</h2>

                            <p>A scenario from the book shows how a lawyer turned down to defend a client, because he
                                knew that his client was guilty. In fact, he declined money by defending the client and
                                walked away. Later on, people worried if he could make tough decisions, when he applied
                                for a political position. They thought that he couldn&rsquo;t be tough when he has
                                concerns for others. But in the long run he earned respect for his decision.</p>

                            <p>People advocate you in the long run, when you are a giver, but they will be your enemies
                                when you act as a taker. You want to collect allies in the long run and build up a
                                reputation as a giver.</p>

                            <p>In the short run you make sacrifices for yourself for the greater cause. By giving and
                                earning reputation and prestige, the giver style will play out to your favor in the long
                                run.</p>

                            <p>In the book you will learn about remarkable people who were in the role of givers, acted
                                to put the good of others or whole nations over their own ego, and succeeded in the long
                                run. &ldquo;It takes time for givers to build goodwill and trust, but eventually, they
                                establish reputations and relationships that enhance their success.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>However, &ldquo;In the long run, giving can be every bit as powerful as it is
                                dangerous.&rdquo; You will need to know how to prevent to end up at the bottom of the
                                success ladder. Adam Grant gives plenty of advices in his book.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="aMarathon">A connected World - Have a Marathon</h2>

                            <p>&ldquo;Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it&rsquo;s valuable in a
                                marathon.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Back in the days, it was more difficult to earn the fruits of being a giver. The
                                environment was more slow paced and you had fewer connections to others. When you would
                                send a generous or supportive letter to someone, no one would know and appreciate it.
                                Most of the time your work dependent only on yourself, not on a team, like it works in
                                companies nowadays.</p>

                            <p>Adam Grant argues that &ldquo;in today&rsquo;s connected world, where relationships and
                                reputations are more visible, givers can accelerate their pace&rdquo;. In a work
                                environment, &ldquo;teams depend on givers to share information, volunteer for unpopular
                                tasks, and provide help.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Adam Grant sees the opportunities in a team, where givers can demonstrate their value and
                                have more opportunities than in the old world. Even in a service environment people
                                depend on each other. You can only be a good lawyer, doctor or teacher when you have the
                                best interest of your clients at your heart.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;The further [students] advance, the more their success depends on teamwork and
                                service. Whereas takers sometimes win in independent roles where performance is only
                                about individual results, givers thrive in interdependent roles where collaboration
                                matters.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="transitionIntoBusiness">The Transition into Business</h2>

                            <p>When researchers conducted experiments about giving and taking values, they found out
                                that giver values are the most popular values across most of the countries. But how can
                                we translate these values in the world of business?</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for quid pro quo; I&rsquo;m looking to make a difference and
                                have an impact, and I focus on the people who can benefit from my help the most.&rdquo;
                                - Sherryann Plesse</p>

                            <p>However, Sherryann Plesse also sees the problems arising with giving: &ldquo;I want my
                                primary skills to be seen as hardworking and results-oriented, not kindness and
                                compassion. In business, sometimes you have to wear different masks.&rdquo; To wear
                                different masks prevents givers from being givers at work. They have to adjust their
                                reciprocity style. Givers become matchers or even worse takers.</p>

                            <p>Givers are fearing exploitation by takers in business. Robert Frank says: &ldquo;By
                                encouraging us to expect the worst in others it brings out the worst in us: dreading the
                                role of the chump, we are often loath to heed our nobler instincts.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>In his book, Adam Grant divides the interactions in the workplace into four key domains:
                                networking, collaborating, evaluating and influencing. These domains happen to be the
                                domains where givers can thrive. It all concludes to benefits that givers enjoy over
                                matchers and takers. Maybe you are a matcher yet want to become a giver after reading
                                the book. The next lessons learned will be about these key domains.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="networking">Networking</h2>

                            <p>Givers and takers grow and manage their networks differently. &ldquo;While givers and
                                takers may have equally large networks, givers are able to produce far more lasting
                                value through their networks.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman once said: &ldquo;It seems counterintuitive, but the more
                                altruistic your attitude, the more benefits you will gain from the relationship.&rdquo;
                            </p>

                            <p>Reid Hoffman supports this perspective: &ldquo;If you set out to help others, you will
                                rapidly reinforce your own reputation and expand your universe of possibilities.&rdquo;
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="the-faker-in-the-network">The Faker in the Network</h3>

                            <p>How to approach networking, when you can&rsquo;t distinguish a giver from a taker?
                                The common sense is that givers protect their networks from takers. Takers know the
                                strategy of protection of a giver and act as fakers: pretending good will to get access
                                to a giver. They can become givers or matchers, but by faking it they are still takers.
                            </p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Although takers tend to be dominant and controlling with subordinates,
                                they&rsquo;re surprisingly submissive and deferential toward superiors. When takers deal
                                with powerful people, they become convincing fakers.&rdquo; says Adam Grant.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Takers may rise by kissing up, but they often fall by kicking down.&rdquo; Takers
                                are worried how they are seen the upward management chain, but not how they are
                                perceived from their coworkers or subordinates. &ldquo;The true measure of a man is how
                                he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="how-to-spot-a-taker">How to spot a Taker</h3>

                            <p>Takers are more likely to use first-person singular pronouns: I, me, mine, my and myself.
                                Givers use words like we, us, our, ours and ourselves.</p>

                            <p>In the past, for instance, it was possible to distinguish taker from giver CEO by
                                comparing annual reports. They used first-person singular pronouns and used a larger
                                photo of themselves than their giver CEO counterparts in the booklet.</p>

                            <p>In addition, the number of people in a network was relatively manageable compared to
                                nowadays. The reputation of each person was transparent for everyone. Nowadays the
                                networks got larger. By using social media and other networks, the interactions became
                                dispersed and anonymous. Reputation became less visible.</p>

                            <p>Yet it became possible to track down the reputation from another person. All the
                                information is available when the other person is not careful with his/her sensitive
                                information. Howard Lee says: &ldquo;Nowadays, I don&rsquo;t need to call in to a
                                company to find out about someone&rsquo;s reputation. Everyone is incredibly connected.
                                Once they make it past the technical rounds, I check their LinkedIn or Facebook.
                                Sometimes we have mutual friends, or went to the same school, or the people on my team
                                will have a link to them.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="punishing-the-taker">Punishing the Taker</h3>

                            <p>When working with identified takers, givers and matchers punish their behavior for being
                                unfair. Before having an imbalance in a collaborative task, givers and matchers decline
                                the cooperation in favor of punishing the takers. Adam Grant says that it is not about
                                revenge, but about justice.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;If we create networks with the sole intention of getting something, we won&rsquo;t
                                succeed.&rdquo; Whereas matchers punish takers for their behavior, they act generously
                                when they collaborate with a giver.</p>

                            <h3 id="growing-a-network">Growing a Network</h3>

                            <p>Networking guru Keith Ferrazzi has written: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to give before you
                                receive.&rdquo; The advice is useful for every reciprocity style, but takers exploit it
                                by offering proactively &ldquo;favors to people whose help they want in the
                                future&rdquo;.</p>

                            <p>Matchers are vulnerable in networking, because they act on quid pro quo. They have
                                smaller networks than givers and takers. Givers and takers have equally large networks.
                            </p>

                            <p>Takers grow their networks to shine and gather proactively opportunities to take. Givers
                                grow their networks to help. They do it without potential payoffs. Adam Grant concludes
                                that there is no prediction who can help us in the future.</p>

                            <h3 id="waking-the-sleeping-giants">Waking the Sleeping Giants</h3>

                            <p>But what are the benefits of being a giver in a network of people? When speaking about
                                relationships, Adam Grant distinguishes between strong and weak ties. Strong ties are
                                your family, close friends and colleagues. Weak ties are the people you know casually.
                                From whom would you expect more in return? Research shows that people benefit more from
                                weak ties than from strong ties.</p>

                            <p>Strong ties stay in the same social circles. They share the same opportunities. Weak ties
                                give us access to different perspectives and opportunities. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible
                                to get the best of both worlds: the trust of strong ties coupled with the novel
                                information of weak ties.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>The important strategy is reconnecting: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the major reason why givers
                                succeed in the long run.&rdquo; Dormant ties, as Adam Grant explains it, are connections
                                from the past that are inactive.</p>

                            <p>In a research experiment, executives had to contact dormant ties that were not active
                                since 3 years to seek advice. Afterward they had to rate the advice. The advice by
                                dormant ties was rated higher than the advice from current ties. &ldquo;The dormant ties
                                provided more novel information than the current contacts. Over the past few years,
                                while they were out of touch, they had been exposed to new ideas and
                                perspectives.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Since dormant ties are inactive, the amount of them grows over time. Eventually the pool
                                of dormant ties gets bigger than weak ties and enables givers to access these
                                opportunities. &ldquo;Dormant ties offer the access to novel information that weak ties
                                afford, but without the discomfort.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Dormant ties are the neglected value in our networks, and givers have a
                                distinctive edge over takers and matchers in unlocking this value.&rdquo; It is fairly
                                difficult for takers to activate dormant ties, because people might be suspicious of
                                their reputation and actions from the past. Instead they might punish the taker.
                                &ldquo;If a taker&rsquo;s self-serving actions were what caused a tie to become dormant
                                in the first place, it may be impossible to revive the relationship at all.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Matchers have it easier than takers to reconnect, but they are uncomfortable doing so.
                                Because of their reciprocity style, they would owe one back. In addition, their
                                connection relied on a transaction rather than trust.</p>

                            <p>Dormant ties of givers appear to be more grateful for the reconnection. It turns out that
                                generosity and kindness earns trust.</p>

                            <p>When plotting takers and givers on a network map, &ldquo;takers were black holes. They
                                suck the energy from those around them. The givers were suns: they injected light around
                                the organization. Givers created opportunities for their colleagues to contribute,
                                rather than imposing their ideas and hogging credit for achievements.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="entering-the-5-minute-favor">Entering the 5-Minute Favor</h3>

                            <p>One strategy of being a giver in a network was revealed by Adam Rifkin who has written
                                265 LinkedIn recommendations for others. It summarizes as: Instead of trading value,
                                givers aim to add value. The rule: &ldquo;You should be willing to do something that
                                will take you five minutes or less for anybody.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Another strategy, when someone seeks advice from a giver, is to delegate it to another
                                person who might be able to help out. It turns out well, because the giver doesn&rsquo;t
                                claim any value for himself/herself but connects people.</p>

                            <p>It prevents burnout as a giver too, as you will learn later, because you have a tool to
                                say no when too many people seek your advice. In addition, it spreads the norm of giving
                                to other people.</p>

                            <p>According to Keith Ferrazzi, there is only one key to success: generosity. &ldquo;If your
                                interactions are ruled by generosity, your rewards will follow suit.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="collaborating">Collaborating</h2>

                            <p>The differences between givers and takers can affect group success.</p>

                            <p>When givers succeed, it spreads and cascades to close people, the team in a company and
                                whole organizations. Adam Grant coins it as the ripple effect, because it enhances the
                                success of others.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;When takers win, there&rsquo;s usually someone else who loses.&rdquo; Because of
                                that effect, research shows that other people support givers and try to knock down
                                takers. Adam Grant says that &ldquo;the difference lies in how giver success creates
                                value, instead of just claiming it&rdquo;. As Randy Komisar says: &ldquo;It&rdquo;s
                                easier to win if everybody wants you to win. If you don&rsquo;t make enemies out there,
                                it&rsquo;s easier to succeed.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="superstars-vs-rockstars">Superstars vs. Rockstars</h3>

                            <p>When speaking about superstars and rockstars, takers are superstars and givers are
                                rockstars.</p>

                            <p>Takers are confident in their skills, they are confident to perform well on their own.
                                But research shows that superstars, even though they trust their individual skills, had
                                a decline in their performance when changing their employer. In conclusion, the
                                performance always depends on the team. Even superstars rely on the expertise, creative
                                ideas and information of their colleagues.</p>

                            <p>Independence is seen as symbol of strength, whereas interdependence is seen as a
                                weakness. Takers lean towards independence, because they perceive themselves as superior
                                and separated from others. &ldquo;Givers reject the notion that interdependence is weak.
                                Givers are more likely to see interdependence as a source of strength, a way to harness
                                the skills of multiple people for a greater good.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="putting-the-group-first">Putting the Group first</h3>

                            <p>Givers expand the pie of success when they put the group first. A team that is
                                contributing towards one goal will grow the pie of success for everyone that it can be
                                shared afterward. Since givers don&rsquo;t put themselves first, they often volunteer
                                for unpopular tasks and offer feedback.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;When givers put a group&rsquo;s interests ahead of their own, they signal that
                                their primary goal is to benefit the group. [&hellip;] Takers no longer feel that they
                                need to compete [&hellip;], matchers feel that they owe [&hellip;]&rdquo; and givers are
                                even more encouraged to contribute.</p>

                            <p>When takers or matchers offer constructive feedback, they can make others stressed or
                                jealous. But when givers give feedback, &ldquo;they no longer have a target on their
                                backs. Instead, givers are appreciated for their contribution to the group.&rdquo; In
                                collaboration, people tend to keep track of each members credits and debits. When acting
                                generously as a giver, you earn a higher status and can deviate from group&rsquo;s norms
                                and expectations.</p>

                            <p>Matchers and takers miss out to give credit to others work. Because of that, they have a
                                hard time in the long run. Givers tend to put the team first, they will mention every
                                member&rsquo;s contribution before they, when they do, mention their own contribution.
                            </p>

                            <p>&ldquo;When giving starts to occur, it becomes the norm, and people carry it forward in
                                interactions with other people. [&hellip;] When groups include one consistent giver, the
                                other members contribute more. The presence of a single giver was enough to establish a
                                norm of giving.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="overcoming-the-responsibility-bias">Overcoming the Responsibility Bias</h3>

                            <p>People tend to estimate their own responsibilities in a project as too high. On the other
                                hand, the value contributed by others will be underestimated. This responsibility bias
                                is a major source of failure in a collaboration. It happens often in the professional
                                world, when a researcher doesn&rsquo;t give credit for his colleagues or a team lead
                                doesn&rsquo;t credit the team but himself/herself.</p>

                            <p>As mentioned, all reciprocity styles, especially matchers, track credits and debits in
                                collaborations. But givers don&rsquo;t act with the intention to get credit in the first
                                place. The focus lays on collaborative achievements. It shows that givers not even
                                remember all the things they contributed.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;The key to balancing our responsibility judgements is to focus our attention on
                                what others have contributed. All you need to Dosis make a list of what your partner
                                contributes before you estimate your own contribution.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>As a giver, it is most often the modus operandi: &ldquo;[givers are] incredibly tough on
                                [themselves] when things go badly, but quick to congratulate others when things go
                                well.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="psychological-safety">Psychological Safety</h3>

                            <p>In positive work environments, there exists a psychological safety that allows people to
                                take risks and to fail. Research has shown that people in such environments learn and
                                innovate more.</p>

                            <p>Givers encourage an environment of failing yet innovating at workplaces, because they
                                don&rsquo;t claim credit as takers or matchers.</p>

                            <p>When too many veteran givers or matchers are superiors, people are intimidated by them.
                                But when givers lead the way, and they earned the role through generosity, people are
                                not intimidated anymore. There is no feeling of competition and everyone contributes to
                                a greater objective.</p>

                            <h3 id="beyond-the-perspective-gap">Beyond the Perspective Gap</h3>

                            <p>Adam Grant argues that givers get beyond the perspective gap. Their empathy and the act
                                of giving itself supports givers to put themselves into the state of someone else.</p>

                            <p>Takers on the other hand focus on their own viewpoints and contributions. They
                                don&rsquo;t reach beyond the perspective gap.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Successful givers shift their frames of reference to the recipient&rsquo;s

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="evaluating">Evaluating</h2>

                            <p>Givers succeed by seeing the potential in others. Believe is one of the core concepts in
                                mentoring and teaching. It creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

                            <p>Research with students and teachers showed that when teachers believed in their students,
                                their students performed better. It didn&rsquo;t depend on the intellectual level of a
                                student. Even though the students made mistakes, teachers acting as givers created a
                                climate of taking risks. It improved the learning and confidence of the students.</p>

                            <p>Givers encourage others to believe in their potential and set high expectations for them
                                to succeed. By seeing the potential in everybody, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
                            </p>

                            <p>Takers are in no good position to teach others. &ldquo;Takers harbor doubts about
                                others&rsquo; intentions, so they monitor vigilantly for information that others might
                                harm them, treating others with suspicion and distrust. These low expectations trigger a
                                vicious cycle, constraining the development and motivation of others. Even when takers
                                are impressed by another person&rsquo;s capabilities or motivation, they&rsquo;re more
                                likely to see this person as a threat, which means they&rsquo;re less willing to support
                                and develop him and her.&rdquo; It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy the other way
                                around.</p>

                            <p>Matchers are more likely to use the power of the self-fulfilling prophecy, but only when
                                they see the potential in someone. They miss out all the people that don&rsquo;t show
                                the potential in the fist place.</p>

                            <p>Since givers treat everyone equally, they are optimistic and create a greater pool of
                                potential people in their network. Adam Grant says that they see everyone as a rough
                                diamond.</p>

                            <p>Chris Granger, executive at the NBA, says: &ldquo;Talented people are attracted to those
                                who care about them. When you help someone get promoted out of your team, it&rsquo;s a
                                short-term loss, but it&rsquo;s a clear long-term gain. It&rsquo;s easier to attract
                                people, because words gets around that your philosophy is to help people.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="the-flaw">The Flaw</h3>

                            <p>Each year companies spend huge amounts of money to identify potential in their future
                                leaders. It builds up on the flaw that talent comes first followed by motivation. But as
                                research shows, by seeing potential in everyone, the pool of talent gets bigger and by
                                encouraging everyone the is potential to grow is unleashed. &ldquo;It turns out that
                                motivation is the reason that people develop talent in the first place.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;As Malcom Gladwell showed us in <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://amzn.to/2oqJdq3">Outliers</a>,
                                research led by psychologist Anders Ericsson reveals that attaining expertise in a
                                domain typically requires ten thousand hours of deliberate practice. But what motivates
                                people to practice at such length in the first place? This is where givers often enter
                                the picture.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>In the end, it is not the talent or abilities of a person. It is the grit. It is the grit
                                that givers see in their students. But as George Anders notes: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
                                take motivation for granted.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Grit is a major factor to predict how close they get to achieving their
                                potential.&rdquo; In conclusion, gritty people are &ldquo;where givers have the greatest
                                return on their investment, the most meaningful and lasting impact.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="investing-on-behalf-of-others">Investing on behalf of Others</h3>

                            <p>Research shows that people &ldquo;make more accurate and creative decisions when
                                they&rsquo;re choosing on behalf of others than themselves&rdquo;.</p>

                            <p>Takers are more vulnerable to an escalation of commitment, because of their ego. Even
                                though a project seems to fail and it gets harder to turn the ship around, takers invest
                                even more into it regardless of the initial investment. In studies, it shows that takers
                                in charge are willing to follow suggestions more likely when they feel less criticized.
                                However, their ego takes over when they get criticized.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Whereas takers often strive to be the smartest people in the room, givers are more
                                receptive to expertise from others, even if it challenges their own beliefs.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Givers see a responsibility towards their team, because they are dedicated to others.
                                They are willing to work harder and longer, committing to grunt work if it needs to be
                                done. &ldquo;Givers focus more on the interpersonal and organization consequences of
                                their decisions, accepting a blow to their pride and reputations in the short term in
                                order to make better choices in the long term.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Research &ldquo;reveals that givers don&rsquo;t excel only at recognizing and developing
                                talent; they&rsquo;re also surprisingly good at moving on when their bets don&rsquo;t
                                work out.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="influencing">Influencing</h2>

                            <p>Adam Grant argues that &ldquo;there are two fundamental paths to influence: dominance and
                                prestige. When we establish dominance, we gain influence because others see us as
                                strong, powerful, and authoritative. When we earn prestige, we become influential
                                because others respect and admire us.&rdquo; While the first path of dominance ties to
                                takers, the second path of prestige is favored by givers.</p>

                            <p>Dominance and prestige can be created by powerful and powerless communication.</p>

                            <p>Our communication is powerful when we show confidence. It can be expressed by how we
                                choose our words or body language. After a while, powerful communication can be resisted
                                by others, because they get skeptical. In addition, it gets more difficult for powerful
                                communicators when other competitors - other powerful communicators - show up.</p>

                            <p>Powerless communication is the opposite: &ldquo;Powerless communicators tend to speak
                                less assertively, expressing plenty of doubt and relying heavily on advice from others.
                                They talk in ways that signal vulnerability, revealing their weakness and making use of
                                disclaimers, hedges, and hesitations.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Adam Grant mentions several language basics in powerless communication.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Hesitations: well, you know, &hellip;</li>
                                <li>Hedges: kinda, probably, &hellip;</li>
                                <li>Disclaimer: it might be not the best approach, but &hellip;</li>
                                <li>Tag questions: that&rsquo;s a good approach, isn&rsquo;t it?</li>
                                <li>Intensifiers: very, quite, &hellip;</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Powerless communication earns prestige: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no limit to the amount of
                                respect and admiration that we can dole out. This means that prestige usually has more
                                lasting value, and it&rsquo;s worth examining how people earn it.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Adam Grant recommends, but I can only agree, to read the book <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://amzn.to/2oJNgRU">Quiet</a> by Susan

                                and introverts.</p>

                            <h3 id="presenting">Presenting</h3>

                            <p>Sometimes it is hard to earn credit in audiences of knowledgeable, most of the time
                                older, people. Whereas powerful communication can lead to even more scepticism in the
                                audience, powerless communication gives you access to the people.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Takers tend to worry that revealing weaknesses will compromise their dominance and
                                authority. Givers are much more comfortable expressing vulnerability: they&rsquo;re
                                interest in helping others, not gaining power over them, so they&rsquo;re not afraid of
                                exposing chinks in their armor. By making themselves vulnerable, givers actually build
                                prestige.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>In addition, the psychological pratfall effect can be used to gain prestige over
                                dominance. Quoting Wikipedia: &ldquo;The pratfall effect is the tendency for
                                attractiveness to increase or decrease after an individual makes a mistake, depending on
                                the individual&rsquo;s perceived ability to perform well in a general sense. A perceived
                                highly-competent individual would be, on average, more likeable after committing a
                                blunder, while the opposite would occur if a perceived average person makes a
                                mistake.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>It supports the notion to appear approachable for the audience, even though you are an
                                expert in your field. Instead of widening the distance between you and your audience,
                                you get closer to them. The effect is one of the strategies to create a Psychological

                            <h3 id="selling">Selling</h3>

                            <p>Regardless of a personal conversation or discussion in a group, takers are more likely to
                                talk. When takers try to sell something, people get suspicious by their powerful
                                communication and get defensive to avoid being tricked.</p>

                            <p>Givers lean towards listening instead of talking which establishes the opportunity to get
                                to know the needs of others. Givers naturally adopt the listening aspect in in powerless
                                communication.</p>

                            <p>In the service industry you can see the difference. Salespeople who are takers are more
                                likely to talk in order to sell their product. Salespeople who are givers will listen
                                and adjust the product to your needs.</p>

                            <p>An optician who sells glasses ones said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look at it as selling. I
                                see myself as an optician. We&rsquo;re in the medical field first, retail second, sales
                                maybe third. My job is to take the patient, ask the patient questions, and see what the
                                patient needs.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Instead of telling people what they want, givers ask questions about their needs.
                                &ldquo;By asking questions and getting to know their customers, givers build trust and
                                gain knowledge about their customers&rsquo; needs. Over time, this makes them better and
                                better at selling.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="persuading">Persuading</h3>

                            <p>Givers are not concerned about the credit. That&rsquo;s why they have an easier time to
                                persuade others. Instead of rushing into a situation to convince someone by using
                                powerful communication, givers take the approach of helping and using powerless
                                communication.</p>

                            <p>Establishing dominance will not work to persuade others, but having prestige by using
                                powerless speech is supporting it.</p>

                            <p>When speaking to subordinates, research shows that there are particular places for
                                powerful speech: &ldquo;when most employees [&hellip;] are dutiful followers, managers
                                are well served to speak powerfully. But when most employees are proactive, generating
                                new ideas [&hellip;], powerful speech backfires.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="negotiating">Negotiating</h3>

                            <p>Imagine you have to negotiate with your manager about a promotion. It is always a
                                difficult topic. &ldquo;Research shows that advice seeking is a surprisingly effective
                                strategy for exercising influence when we lack authority.&rdquo; Seeking advice is a one
                                form of powerless speech, because a person shows vulnerability and wants to learn
                                something.</p>

                            <p>Givers put the other person in their shoes. The other person has to consider it from a
                                different perspective. Givers are able to change the point of view of the other person.
                                Whereas a manager would have seen the best interest for the company in the beginning of
                                the conversation, the manager would see now the benefits and opportunities for the
                                employee. The manager puts himself or herself as mentor of a mentee.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;When we give our time, energy, knowledge, or resources to help others, we strive
                                to maintain a belief that they&rsquo;re worthy and deserving of our help. Seeking advice
                                is a subtle way to invite someone to make a commitment to us.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;When persuading and negotiating, givers speak tentatively and seek advice because
                                they truly value the ideas and viewpoints others.&rdquo; That should make it fairly easy
                                to fake it as a taker, but research shows that takers who become fakers fail most of the
                                time.</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;When we ask people for advice, we grant them prestige, showing that we respect and
                                admire their insights and expertise.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>After you have learned about the 4 key domains where givers can thrive, the question in

                                ladder.</p>

                            <p>A lot of givers burn out at some point, because they are not avoiding the pitfalls of
                                giving. &ldquo;If people give away too much credit and engage in too much powerless
                                communication, it&rsquo;s all too easy for them to become pushovers and doormats,
                                failing to advance their own interests. The consequence: givers end up exhausted and
                                unproductive.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Research shows that &ldquo;successful givers weren&rsquo;t just more other oriented than
                                their peers; they were also more self-interested. Successful givers, it turns out, are
                                just as ambitious as takers and matchers.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3 id="entering-self-interest-and-other-interest">Entering Self-Interest and Other-Interest
                            </h3>

                            <p>Takers have a high self-interest, but low other-interest. Givers have a high other
                                interest, but vary in self-interest. That&rsquo;s the crucial point in the personality
                                of a giver.</p>

                            <p>It leads to two types of givers: selfless givers (low self-interest, high other interest)
                                and otherish givers (high self-interest, high other interest).</p>

                            <p>Adam Grant found out that self-interest and other-interest are independent motivations.
                                These motivations are not competing with each other. Bill Gates once said: &ldquo;There
                                are two great forces of human nature: self-interest, and caring for others&rdquo;. He
                                calls it a hybrid engine and concludes that people are successful when they make use of
                                both.</p>

                            <h3 id="how-to-prevent-giver-burnout">How to prevent Giver Burnout?</h3>

                            <p>Barbara Oakley, researcher, once said that selfless giving, or pathological altruism, is
                                &ldquo;an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one&rsquo;s own needs&rdquo;.
                                Adam Grant concludes: &ldquo;Since givers tend to put others&rsquo; interests ahead of
                                their own, they often help others at the expense of their own well-being, placing
                                themselves at risk of burnout.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>The question is: How can givers prevent burnout?</p>

                            <h4 id="impact-of-giving">Impact of Giving</h4>

                            <p>Research shows that givers need a motivation aspect behind their giving. &ldquo;They
                                [need] a stronger emotional grasp of their impact.&rdquo; For instance, when donating,
                                they want to see the impact. When teaching, they want to see the progress of their
                                students.</p>

                            <p>Adam Grant says that giver burnout &ldquo;has less to do with the amount of giving and
                                more with the amount of feedback about the impact of that giving&rdquo;. Giver burnout
                                is linked to givers who feel that they make no difference. Companies build up on this
                                knowledge to show their employees the impact they have, regardless of where they are
                                working.</p>

                            <h4 id="seek-social-support-change-the-domain">Seek Social Support, Change the Domain</h4>

                            <p>Burnout expert Christina Maslach and their colleagues say that &ldquo;there is now a
                                consistent and strong body of evidence that a lack of social support is linked to
                                burnout&rdquo;. By giving, givers build up a network of supporters. These supporters can
                                be accessed any time to get encouragement or advice. Research shows that otherish givers
                                access their pool of supporters more likely than selfless givers.</p>

                            <p>Another strategy to prevent giver burnout can be to change the domain. Instead of giving
                                more to one and the same group of people, expanding the giving to other groups of people
                                can be rewarding for givers.</p>

                            <h4 id="chunking-vs-sprinkling">Chunking vs. Sprinkling</h4>

                            <p>Research shows that people gain more happiness when they chunk the act of giving rather
                                than sprinkle it over time. For instance, it has a greater impact to perform multiple
                                acts of kindness in one day than doing the same amount of giving sprinkled over one
                                week. Selfless givers perform giving after work, whereas otherish givers get recharged
                                during the week to be able to give during the weekend.</p>

                            <p>The technique of chunking gets adopted by companies too. They slice their weekdays into
                                productive quite time and giving time to help or to seek advice. More research shows
                                that giving during work time only affects productivity when the giver lacks skills of
                                time management.</p>

                            <h4 id="the-100-hour-rule-of-volunteering">The 100-hour rule of Volunteering</h4>

                            <p>Experiments have shown the best amount of time to spend on volunteering regarding
                                happiness. It seems that people who volunteer more than 100 hours but less than 800
                                hours are more satisfied than people volunteering outside of these time constraints. The
                                100-hour rule of volunteering is &ldquo;the range where giving is maximally energizing
                                and minimally draining&rdquo;. 100 hours a year breaks down to only two hours a week.
                            </p>

                            <p>The act of volunteering has a lasting impact, because the satisfaction of people goes up
                                one year later. Other research shows that the energizing impact of giving wasn&rsquo;t
                                felt during but after the act of giving. Is the act of giving itself a <a
                                    href="../lessons-learned-deep-work-flow/index.html">flow</a> activity?</p>

                            <p>Companies, who struggle to give their employees time for volunteering, should learn about
                                these benefits. But the act of volunteering has to be meaningful to the employee without
                                being an obligation. It shouldn&rsquo;t be enforced by the company.</p>

                            <h4 id="meaningfulness-and-happiness">Meaningfulness and Happiness</h4>

                            <p>All these strategies help otherish givers to keep up their commitment and stamina. By
                                making use of them, they outperform takers, matchers and obviously selfless givers.
                                &ldquo;Otherish givers may appear less altruistic than selfless givers, but their
                                resilience against burnout enables them to contribute more.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Giving is associated with a meaningful act that activates the feeling of purpose in our
                                lives. &ldquo;[Givers] build up reserves of happiness and meaning that takers and
                                matchers are less able to access. Selfless givers use up these reserves, exhausting
                                themselves and often dropping to the bottom of the success ladder. By giving in ways
                                that are energizing rather than exhausting, otherish givers are more likely to rise to
                                the top.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>As you know by now, givers end up at the top or bottom of the success ladder. Givers can
                                burnout when they don&rsquo;t follow the strategies of an otherish giver</p>

                            <p>But there are more pitfalls for givers. For takers, it can be easy to exploit givers as
                                doormats. &ldquo;Trust is one reason that givers are so susceptible to the doormat
                                effect: they tend to see the best in everyone, so they operate on the mistaken
                                assumption that everyone is trustworthy.&rdquo; The question is: How to protect from a
                                taker as a giver?</p>

                                person can be very important to distinguish givers from other reciprocity styles.</p>

                            <p>If you take more time, by listening to a person, you can wait for clues that reveal the
                                person as a taker or giver. Takers are more likely to use first-person pronouns. In
                                addition, they use more time in talking than listening. They are not listening to your
                                needs.</p>

                                Disagreeable</h4>

                            <p>&ldquo;Agreeable people tend to appear cooperative and polite - they seek harmony with
                                others, coming across as warm, nice, and welcoming. Disagreeable people tend to be more
                                competitive, critical, and though-they&rsquo;re more comfortable with conflict, coming
                                across as skeptical and challenging.&rdquo; It would be too obvious now to say that
                                takers are disagreeable and givers are agreeable. It turns out that takers can be
                                agreeable and givers can be disagreeable.</p>

                            <h4 id="start-out-as-giver-become-a-matcher">Start out as Giver, Become a Matcher</h4>

                            <p>Once you revealed a person as a taker, it makes sense to shift the reciprocity style to a
                                matcher when being a giver. The strategy is called <em>tit for tat</em> by game
                                theorists: &ldquo;Start out cooperating, and stay cooperative unless your counterpart
                                competes. When your counterpart competes, match the behavior by competing too. This is a
                                wildly effective form of matching that has won many game theory tournaments.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>An advanced strategy is called the <em>generous tit for tat</em>: &ldquo;Never forget a
                                good turn, but occasionally forgive a bad one.&rdquo; You should be generous in a third
                                of your actions, even though the counterpart acts as taker. &ldquo;Generous tit for tat
                                achieves a powerful balance of rewarding giving and discouraging taking, without being
                                overly punitive.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Don&rsquo;t put yourself on the spot, but others when negotiating. Act on behalf of your

                                companies best interest when negotiating.</p>

                            <p>Don&rsquo;t carry the burden alone when someone seeks your advice. See with whom you can
                                connect the person. It would turn out as a win-win situation for everyone. You can keep
                                giving and the other people create a giving culture too. A rippling effect will evolve
                                and you make the pie bigger to give and take.</p>

                            <h4 id="embrace-giving-in-collaborations">Embrace Giving in Collaborations</h4>

                            <p>The ripple effect when a giver collaborates with a group of people was already mentioned.
                                Knowing about this effect, makes it possible to let everyone in the group act more like
                                givers. &ldquo;If a group develops a norm of giving, members will uphold the norm and
                                give, even if they&rsquo;re more inclined to be takers or matchers elsewhere. This
                                reduces the risks of giving: when everyone contributes, the pie is larger, and givers
                                are no longer stuck contributing far more than they get.&rdquo; Companies can make use
                                of this knowledge and embrace collaborations in groups where givers are active.</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="givingCommunity">The Giving Community</h2>

                            <p>Research has shown that when takers and matchers are in a sharing community of givers,
                                they will experience the feeling of oneness. They belong to the sharing community and
                                will act as givers. Even though they might have started the collaboration out of selfish
                                interests.</p>

                            <p>In a sharing community, people develop a feeling a responsibility, while in other
                                communities there is only the atomic transaction without a lasting impact. &ldquo;People
                                are motivated to give to others when they identify as part of a common community.&rdquo;
                            </p>

                            <h3 id="attracted-to-a-common-ground">Attracted to a Common Ground</h3>

                            <p>A common ground can be a perfect foundation in a giving culture. People from the same
                                city, with similar preferences or even the same name can experience a feeling of
                                oneness. In general, people like to be reminded of themselves.</p>

                            <p>For instance, research shows that more people with the name Jack live in Jacksville and
                                more people with the name Georgia live in Georgia. Names can be associated to
                                professions as well. Like someone with the name Dennis is more likely to become a
                                dentist than a person with the name Jack.</p>

                            <p>On the other hand, people want to be unique even though they value common ground.
                                Marilynn Brewer, a psychologist, calls is optimal distinctiveness. Her theory says that
                                &ldquo;we strive for connection, cohesiveness, community, belonging, inclusion, and
                                affiliation with others. On the other hand, we want to stand out; we search for
                                uniqueness, differentiation, and individuality. As we navigate the social world, these
                                two motives are often in conflict. The more strongly e affiliate with a group, the
                                greater our risk of losing our sense of uniqueness. The more we work to distinguish
                                ourselves from others, the greater our risk of losing our sense of belongingness.&rdquo;
                            </p>

                            <p>In conclusion, when joining a group with a shared interest, but the group is unique in
                                itself, the more likely it facilitates a bond. It creates a shared identity and can
                                apply for giving communities too.</p>

                                When people get reminded continuously of the act of giving, because others do it, they
                                will give too. Takers will adopt the behavior as well. At least because it might be
                                embarrassing not to give.</p>

                            <p>In an experiment, people where reminded annually of their energy consumption and the
                                average energy consumption of the community. Over time, the takers adopted their
                                behavior and used less energy. In conclusion, it helps to show people how they perform
                                relative to the community.</p>

                            <h3 id="reciprocity-rings">Reciprocity Rings</h3>

                            <p>Too often our environment is designed to be a win-lose contest. It starts in our
                                education, in schools and universities, yet continuous during our professional live.
                                People become naturally takers because of the competition. Giving becomes a minority and
                                it is a uncommon thing to do. Even though people are givers, they don&rsquo;t want to be
                                mistaken because other people don&rsquo;t share their reciprocity style.</p>

                            <p>A win-lose contest can poison a company culture. &ldquo;If many people personally believe
                                in giving, but assume that others don&rsquo;t, the whole norm in a group or a company
                                can shift away from giving&rdquo;. Adam Grant believes that it creates a self-fulfilling
                                prophecy, because &ldquo;when people assume that others aren&rsquo;t givers, they act
                                and speak in ways that discourage others from giving&rdquo;.</p>

                            <p>The reciprocity ring is a strategy to disrupt the self-fulfilling prophecy.
                                In the real world &ldquo;people feel pressured to look successful all the time. There
                                can&rsquo;t be any chinks in their armor, and opening up would make them
                                vulnerable&rdquo;.</p>

                            <p>Reciprocity rings embraces this vulnerability. People gather and ask for help. They make
                                themselves vulnerable but offer others the opportunity to give. The requests can be
                                surprising and emotional; even among powerful CEOs and managers. You should definitely
                                read the book to hear their stories.</p>

                            <p>Since there are no transactions in a reciprocity ring, matchers cannot give back
                                directly. But they can give back indirectly to others that leads to a ripple effect.
                                Takers on the other hand don&rsquo;t want to be seen as selfish. They even enjoy it to
                                give when it is publicly. &ldquo;By making contributions visible, the reciprocity ring
                                sets up an opportunity for people of any reciprocity style to be otherish: they can do
                                good and look good at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h2 class="chapter-header" id="howDoIKnow">How do I know who I am until I see what I do?
                            </h2>

                            <p>In the end, I want to ask you: What is your reciprocity style? The writer E. M. Forster
                                once wrote: &ldquo;How do I know who I am until I see what I do?&rdquo; Independent of
                                the reciprocity style, when people start to give continuously, it becomes part of their
                                identity.</p>

                            <p>Adam Grant calls it &ldquo;an active process of cognitive dissonance: once I&rsquo;ve
                                made the voluntary decision to give, I can&rsquo;t change the behavior, so the easiest
                                way to stay consistent and avoid hypocrisy is to decide that I&rsquo;m a giver.&rdquo;
                            </p>

                            <p>Studies have shown that when people start to join volunteering organizations, even when
                                it is for selfish reasons, they become more of a giving individual over time. It becomes
                                a part of their identities. It is a pattern seen by researchers that evolves out of
                                repeated acts of voluntary efforts.</p>

                            <p>Even in companies, when people help their colleagues, it gets branded into the identity
                                and giving becomes a norm in the company. &ldquo;Because of their tendencies toward
                                powerful speech and claiming credit, successful takers tend to dominate the spotlight.
                                But if you start paying attention to reciprocity styles in your own workplace, [Adam
                                Grant has] a hunch that you&rsquo;ll discover plenty of givers achieving the success to
                                which you aspire.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>In addition, Adam Grant says: &ldquo;Focus attention and energy on making a difference
                                the lives of others, and success might follow as a by-product.&rdquo; Similar to a <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="http://amzn.to/2pfekKc">flow</a> activity where success follows eventually.
                            </p>

                            <p>Last but not least, I want to mention the call to action for companies by Adam Grant:
                                &ldquo;[Givers] see success in terms of making significant, lasting contributions to a
                                broad range of people. [&hellip;] Taking this definition of success seriously might
                                require dramatic changes in the way that organizations hire, evaluate, reward, and
                                promote people. It would mean paying attention not only to the productivity of
                                individual people but also to the ripple effect of this productivity on others. If we
                                broadened our image of success to include contributions to others along with individual
                                accomplishments, people might be motivated to tilt their professional reciprocity styles
                                toward giving.&rdquo;</p>
