                            <p>While the contents of our pages have been created with utmost care and due diligence, we
                                cannot assume liability for the completeness and timeliness of the contents. Pursuant to
                                § 7, Paragraph 1 of the German Broadcast Media Act (TMG), and in accordance with general
                                law, as service provider we are responsible for our own content on this web page.
                                However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG we, as service provider, are neither obliged to
                                monitor transmitted or stored external information, nor to research circumstances that
                                suggest an illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information
                                remain, in accordance with legal regulations, unaffected. Any liability in this respect
                                can be assumed only from the moment that knowledge of the specific breach of law is
                                obtained. In the event that the corresponding violations become known, we shall remove
                                these contents immediately.</p>
                            <h3 id="liability-for-links">Liability for Links</h3>
                            <p>Our offer contains links to external websites operated by third parties, on whose
                                contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume liability for these contents.
                                Instead, it is the relevant supplier or operator of the linked web pages who is
                                responsible for the content of these pages. The linked pages were inspected for possible
                                legal infringements at the time the link was established. At the time of linking, no
                                unlawful contents were detectable. Permanent monitoring of the content of the linked
                                pages is infeasible without any specific indication of an infringement of rights. In the
                                event that corresponding violations become known, we shall remove the corresponding
                                links immediately.</p>

                                subject to German copyright law. Their duplication, processing, distribution, or any
                                form of commercialization beyond the scope of the copyright law requires the written
                                consent of the respective author or creator. Copies and downloads are allowed solely for
                                private and non-commercial purposes. Insofar as this page&rsquo;s contents were not
                                created by its operator, third-party copyrights will be respected and observed. Should
                                you still have reason to believe that a copyright violation has occurred despite the
                                precautionary measures taken, we kindly ask you to notify us. In the event that the
                                corresponding violations become known, we shall remove this content immediately.</p>

                            <p>We would like to point out that the transfer of data via the internet (e.g. when
                                communicating via e-mail) may involve security gaps. A complete protection of data
                                against third-party access is impossible.</p>

                                The operator of the pages reserve the right to take legal action in the case of
                                transmission of non-solicited advertising material (e. g. spam mail).</p>
