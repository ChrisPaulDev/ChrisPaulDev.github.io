                            <p>There a various tutorials showing you how to host your web applications with a couple of
                                lines on any hosting solution. But that&rsquo;s it. You are able to host your
                                application somewhere, but there are a lot of open questions. What about using an own
                                domain? What about securing it with SSL? What about hosting multiple applications side
                                by side yet keeping it cost efficient by not taking up to much ressources? This article
                                should fill the void and provide you a solution on how to host multiple applications on
                                Digital Ocean. Disclaimer: I am not payed by Digital Ocean to write the article, but I
                                enjoy using their product and I hope to give you guidance to setup your applications on
                                their platform as well.</p>

                            <p>So what is the definition of an &ldquo;application&rdquo; for this article? In my cases,
                                I host static websites, node.js applications with server-side rendered applications and
                                node.js applications as pure APIs on Digital Ocean. It might be something different for
                                you, but if you know the basic steps to setup a static website or node application on
                                your hosting provider&rsquo;s platform, I believe that you can host any type of
                                &ldquo;application&rdquo; on it.</p>

                            <p>All of my static websites, node applications and standalone APIs are hosted on Digital
                                Ocean&rsquo;s Droplets. In the end of this article, you should be able to do the same
                                for your applications. It should be horizontally scalable and you should be able to take
                                ownership of it. Digital Ocean gave me a perfect start in the world of hosting and
                                taking control of it, because it is a pleasant experience to use their platform. They
                                have a handful of out of the box solutions to bootstrap your virtual machine and there
                                are plenty of high quality tutorials guiding you through the most common scenarios. Most
                                of the time, you can just copy and paste their instructions to the command line of your
                                local machine or remote server, but if you need elaborated explanations for these
                                commands, you will surely find them in their tutorials. Furthermore, I find it is a cost
                                efficient way to host applications on their platform. For instance, I host a bunch of
                                websites side by side on a single 5$ Droplet and you can do the same with your
                                applications.</p>

                            <p>The article is a checklist, because it doesn&rsquo;t explain every step from scratch, but
                                refers to all the necessary tutorials written by Digital Ocean for the whole setup.
                                Furthermore, the article describes the whole process for macOS users, because I use it
                                myself. However, I believe you can substitute most of the things for Windows and Linux.
                            </p>

                            <p>If you find any mistakes, pitfalls or potential improvements for the article, please
                                write it in the comments. The article may not be 100% complete, but I hope to give you
                                the foundations to setup everthing yourself. If there is something missing, please write
                                it down in the commtents as well.</p>

                            <p>The following walkthrough will guide you through the setup process of hosting a single or

                                websites and (2) node applications differs, so depending on your use case, keep an eye
                                open for these numbers. A chapter without any numbering should be applied to both use
                                cases, a chapter with an (1) should be applied for a single or multiple static websites
                                on one Droplet and a chapter with a (2) should be applied for a single or multiple node
                                applications on one Droplet. So if you are only here for the node applications, you can
                                skip all the (1) parts. If you are only here for the static websites, you can skip all
                                the (2) parts.</p>

                            <p>In the end, there will be a couple of dedicated articles, following up after this
                                article, about</p>

                                Digital Ocean Droplet. After all, this article should be sufficient to understand the
                                fundamentals of how it works.</p>

                            <p>Note that the approach for (2) is opinionated. There are many ways to host your node
                                applications. This article will use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                                but share the same domain. You can access them independently by using subdomains. Dokku
                                might not be the newest and coolest kid on the block, but it comes with all the
                                neccessary building blocks. There are other alternatives (e.g. Flynn) as well that are
                                not covered in this article.</p>

                            <p>If I didn&rsquo;t loose your attention by now, let&rsquo;s start with the walkthrough.
                                Before you start, check if you have <a href="../developer-setup/index.html">most of the
                                    essential developer tools</a> which are needed in the following article.</p>

                                bonus. It would allow you to try a Droplet to host all of your applications on their
                                platform for 2 months. If you like it, stay with them and I earn a little bonus as well.
                                If you don&rsquo;t like it, you can always try a different hosting solution.</p>

                            <p>Next you are going to create a Droplet on their platform. It is basically a server that
                                is hosted somewhere else for you. When creating the Droplet, you can make decisions for
                                a couple of properties: image, size and datacenter region. All the other properties
                                aren&rsquo;t that important in the beginning and you can keep their default settings.
                                You don&rsquo;t need to add anything for the SSH properties as well, because you will do
                                it from scratch later on.</p>

                            <ul>

                                    <p><strong>Image:</strong> The image can either be a Linux distribution or a
                                        pre-configured Linux distribution by using a one-click app. I recommend to use
                                        Ubuntu as Linux distribution to get you started from scratch for (1). By going
                                        this path, you will understand every step that you take along the way and learn
                                        about hosting your own application(s). If you want to setup your node
                                        applications for (2), choose the Dokku one-click app instead of a plain Linux
                                        Distribution.</p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Size:</strong> The smallest Droplet size should be everything you need to
                                        get you started in hosting your own applications. Later on, you can always
                                        resize your Droplet. It makes sense if you need the performance and storage
                                        benefits comming with it. Personally I never ran into problems using 5$ or $10
                                        Droplets even though more than 100 visitors are simultanously on your website.

                                    <p><strong>Datacenter Region:</strong> The datacenter region should be located not
                                        far away from the greater part of your audience. If your application users will
                                        be from the US, choose a datacenter region that is closest to the US. But
                                        don&rsquo;t worry too much about it now, because there are solutions to serve
                                        your audience in every region well by using services such as Cloudfare later on.

                                you can access your Droplet dashboard on Digital Ocean where you can find your Droplet
                                and its IP address. By having the IP address, you can access it on the command line by
                                using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>.</p>

                            <p>What&rsquo;s SSH? SSH is a network protocol that allows you to access your server
                                remotely. It can be used on the command line and you would access your remote server by
                                using a username and password. In addition, you can secure it by setting up a SSH key
                                which allows you to skip the part of providing your username and password every time
                                when you log in to your remote server. No worries, you will do everything from scratch
                                in this article.</p>

                            <p>Fortunately, macOS comes with a pre-installed SSH client on the command line. When you
                                open your terminal, you can access your Droplet (remote server) by using your IP
                                address. On the command line type <code>ssh root@your_server_ip</code>. If you log in
                                for the first time by using SSH, you need to provide your password that was emailed to
                                you when you created your Droplet. Continue to follow the more detailed instructions

                            <p>You are ready to serve your own applications. Before you have created server blocks for
                                two sample websites. Now you can reuse those for your applications or create new server
                                blocks for them. The next question is: how do you get your application to your Digital

                                your remote server is using Git. If you are not familiar with Git and haven&rsquo;t

                            <p>Various web application projects are using a build tool. That way, you are able to build
                                your application on the command line and get all files to host it on a web server
                                excluding the source code files. Often the command is simply <code>npm run build</code>
                                and you will get a <em>public/</em> folder with all your build files. I will refer to
                                the <em>public/</em> folder as build folder in the next parts of this post. Keep in
                                mind, the name of the build folder can be something different in your case. The
                                <code>npm run build</code> command will be used as well in the next part, even though it
                                might differ for you too.</p>

                            <p>Next you have to make a decision: You can either decide to build your application on your
                                local machine and only synchronize the build folder with Git to your remote server or
                                synchronize the whole application to your remote server and build it there. The article
                                will use the former option. If you have only a $5 Droplet, you should do it as well,
                                because the Droplet isn&rsquo;t powerful enough to build your application on the remote
                                server. If you have a more powerful Droplet than 5$, you could take the latter option
                                and build your application on your remote server. But keep in mind that you may have to
                                install <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04">node
                                    and npm</a> on your remote server. Check if those are installed there by using
                                <code>node -v</code> and <code>npm -v</code> on the remote sever&rsquo;s command line.
                            </p>

                            <p>So how to get the build folder to your remote server and serve it as website? First, make
                                sure to run your build once on the command line with <code>npm run build</code> or the
                                command that is used for your application type. Afterward, all the build files should be
                                available in the build folder. On GitHub, create a new repository with your application
                                name (e.g. my-foo-bar). Then follow the GitHub instructions to connect your application
                                from your local machine with your new repository. Now you can push the whole application
                                to your GitHub repository. Before you do so, make sure that the build folder shows up
                                when you type <code>git status</code> on the command line. If it doesn&rsquo;t show up,
                                remove it from your <code>.gitignore</code> file to be able to synchronize it.
                                Afterward, push everything to your centralized GitHub account.</p>

                            <p>That&rsquo;s it for the local machine part. Now login to your remote server by using SSH.
                                Per default, you should end up in your home folder of your remote server. There you can
                                git clone your previously synced application from GitHub.</p>

                            <p>Previously, when you have set up your server blocks with your simple websites, you only
                                had an <em>index.html</em> file in your <em>/var/www/mydomain.com/html</em> folder. Your
                                build folder of your application should have an <em>index.html</em> file as entry point
                                as well. You can check it on the command line coming from your home folder.</p>

                            <div class="highlight" style="background: #2f1e2e">
                                <pre style="line-height: 125%"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span></span><span style="color: #06b6ef">cd</span> <span style="color: #06b6ef">my</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">-</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">application</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">-</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">foo</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">-</span><span style="color: #06b6ef">bar</span><span style="color: #5bc4bf">/</span><span style="color: #815ba4">public</span>
<span style="color: #06b6ef">ls</span>
</code></pre>
                            </div>


                            <p>Now, you only need to put the build folder somehow in the
                                <em>/var/www/mydomain.com/html</em> folder. Afterward, your website would already be
                                served for your mapped domain or plain IP address. The naive way would be to copy the
                                whole build folder into the <em>/var/www/mydomain.com/html</em> folder. However, if you
                                want to keep an updated application that you can easily synchronized with GitHub, you
                                would always have to move the build folder to the <em>html/</em> folder once you have
                                pulled a new update from GitHub in your application folder. Therefore, it is more
                                efficient to symlink your build folder with your <em>/var/www/mydomain.com/html</em>
                                folder. A symbolic link is only a reference to this folder and thus both destinations
                                stay updated once you pull an updated version from GitHub. On the command line, on your
                                remote server, it is only one command to symlink both folders:</p>

                                can be seen online, you need to adjust one part in your server block. Open your server
                                block file with <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com</code> and add
                                the public folder to the extended path.</p>

                                <code>git pull --rebase origin master</code>. Your application should be updated when

                                There are a couple of furhter improvements when you continue to read the article. But

                                applications, you can continue to read here after you have finished the initial setup
                                and perhaps your domain setup. Basically you only have to follow one guide, <a
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-dokku-application">How
                                    to Use the DigitalOcean Dokku Application</a>, which covers 3 essential steps (plus
                                the deployment of your application).</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Browsing to your IP address</li>
                                <li>Add your public SSH key that you created in a previous step</li>
                                <li>Configure your domain, if you have obtained one, otherwise keep using the IP address
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Afterward, you are able to deploy your application directly form your local machine. You
                                will need Git on the command line to synchronize your application from your local
                                machine with your Droplet. If you haven&rsquo;t installed Git and GitHub yet, follow
                                this article: <a href="../git-essential-commands/index.html">GitHub and Git
                                    essentials</a>.</p>

                            <p>Now on the command line, you can add your remote Dokku instance to your Git project on
                                your local machine.</p>

                            <p>Make sure to read the linked article which will step you through the whole process in
                                more detail. After you have finished everything said in the article, you should be able
                                to find your application with the used subdomain on your IP address and domain if you
                                have used one. You can read more about Dokku in their <a target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/getting-started/installation/">official
                                    documentation</a>.</p>

                            <p>You can use subdomains to distribute your applications horizontally on your Dokku
                                instance. Personally I use these to create various personal APIs (e.g. a <a
                                    href="../react-express-stripe-payment/index.html">Stripe payment server</a> or an
                                authentication server with Passport.js) or to create one application with multiple
                                instances (e.g. test, staging, production) in one Dokku Droplet.</p>

                            <p>For instance, this way I could end up with the following applications distributed along
                                multiple subdomains in one Dokku instance.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Stripe Payment Server as standalone API:</strong>
                                    stripe-payment.mydomain.com</li>
                                <li><strong>Passport.js Authentication Server as standalone API:</strong>
                                    authentication-passport.mydomain.com</li>
                                <li><strong>Email Server as standalone API:</strong> email.mydomain.com</li>
                                <li><strong>Application (Test):</strong> 02-test.mydomain.com</li>
                                <li><strong>Application (Staging):</strong> 01-staging.mydomain.com</li>
                                <li><strong>User Facing Application (Production):</strong> 00-production.mydomain.com
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>I could even add other public facing applications next to it, where the domain
                                isn&rsquo;t crucial. I did it to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                    href="https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/">automate the Slack
                                    invitation</a> for people learning React.js.</p>

                            <p>Because the subdomains are ordered in an alphabetical order on Dokku, the first subdomain
                                showing up, in this case 00-production, is used as default when browsing to the
                                mydomain.com domain. Essentially I did the same when <a
                                    href="../how-to-build-your-own-course-platform/index.html">I have built my own

                                infrastructure in various microservices.</p>

                                shouldn&rsquo;t forget to setup once a recurring certificate renewal by using a cron

                                static websites, node applications or APIs. The article doesn&rsquo;t attempt to be
                                comprehensive, but at least it should have summarized all the crucial points.</p>
